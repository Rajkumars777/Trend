6935c74531d8c40e50b468d8,1h8kzon,TRUE,General Agriculture,Positive,0.5192,0.5642,,,,,,ecotypespecifics,"Hello snarkers!\n\nI've been lurking on this subreddit ever since watching Jordan and McKay's deep dive into Ballerina Farm, and want to share a bit of my perspective as a land steward, small farmer, as well as Indigenous person (I promise that is relevant to the following info). So many of you here highlight and archive important things about BF that their viewers/consumers deserve to know, so thank you for doing that work! I hope the information I share helps inform some of the ways that their operation and romanticization of 'farm life' impacts the real, under-privileged people who seek to work the land.\n\n**Online Ag Influencing**\n\nFirstly, I want to mention that content creation is actually quite a beneficial tool for small farmers and gardeners. Particularly for urban farms and gardens. A significant amount of urban farms/gardens don't produce enough yields to sustain the cost of production AND a liveable wage. Many of them rely on grants, loans, and volunteers. So content creation (and farm consulting) has been a beneficial tool for urban growers to help supplement their income.Which can be particularly helpful for BIPOC farmers with small farms since they are less likely to be able to purchase 300+ acres in the United States.\n\nFarmers who also make content online typically have an audience of fellow gardeners/farmers. **Largely because working the land for a living becomes the biggest part of their life**. I bring this up to say that if working the land was at the forefront of Hannah and Daniel's life, that would absolutely translate into their content. Look up any real agriculture/garden influencer and you'll see the difference.\n\nWhat kind of invasive plants are on their land? How are they treating them? How are they preparing for the potential of H5N1 affecting their production? What routes do they take for animal husbandry? What integrated pest management techniques do they use to prevent the spread of weeds that are toxic to cattle? They're not entitled to share this aspect of ranching in their content, however, I think it's very telling that they don't. It could be because they genuinely don't interact with this aspect of their supposed lifestyle, it could be because they know it would break the romanticization, it could be a mixture of both.\n\nI think we all agree that their 'farm lifestyle' is a romanticized, unreal portrayal of what actual ranching/farming is. They're influencers first and foremost. What they are attempting to portray is not the lifestyle of someone who works the land for a living. The lifestyle Hannah is *really* trying to sell is a fantasy appeal to the so called 'old ways' of the world. But I'd like to remind you, who were the *'good old days'* really good for?\n\n**Why BF tricking people into believing that they are ranchers for a living harms people working the land**\n\nObviously, BF (Or whoever they hired as a marketer) are quite talented at selling their lifestyle, and thus make great sales from their audience. Luckily many online have proved that the so-called 'Ballerina Farms' meat that they sell doesn't even guarantee that it comes from the actual BF, and that the homewares they sell are all basically dropshipped. However, they still make money selling this crap. From my perspective, they're ag grifters. Homestead LARPers. However, they're successful at it (with a little help from that JetBlue money). Their success and fame inevitably will attract people to attempt to do the same grift. This is already a large problem with homestead/prepper content creators, many of which are problematic as it is. **Every day 2,000 acres of agricultural land are paved over, fragmented, or converted to uses that jeopardize farming.** Things are bleak. If what little farmland remains is being split between actual farmers who feed us, and influencers who want to be trad-wives online, things will be even more bleak. Land access is a MAJOR problem, especially to BIPOC farmers. **The U.S. lost a total of 1.9 million acres of farmland in 2022. We cannot afford to provide this scarce resource to rich folks who prioritize influencing over feeding people.** I will go as far as to say it is extremely negligent of them to own 300 acres of land to use solely as a dairy ranch. But I'll touch on that more later.\n\n**Trad-wife, 'Little House on the Prairie' aesthetic, cottagecore, whatever you want to call it. It can harm Indigenous People.**\n\nBefore I get into this, I feel it is important to say I am Southern Indigenous. My family came to the US as migrant farmworkers. My partner who I steward the land with is Native American from a US federally recognized tribe.\n\nMuch of the Southwest, including the now-state of Utah, used to be part of Mexico. Meaning the encroachment, land seizing and genocide toward the tribes of Utah happened by more than one settler nation. Making the remnants of colonialism extremely impactful to this day. Early conventional agricultural practices and homesteads played a major role in colonizing the land. I'm not bringing this up to accuse BF of anything. I bring this up to mention that idealizing yesteryear, cannot be separated from the fact that the farming of European plants and animals (AKA conventional farming) and homesteading were used as tools of colonization. In fact, between 1891-1912, the government made reservation land set aside for Native Americans in Utah actually available to homesteaders! Americans stealing native land to give to homesteaders and farmers happened not as long ago as many might think. Which makes their romanticization of early rural America all the more harmful. I'll include a link about this below.\n\nYou might be thinking 'Well BF didn't buy this land on a reservation or homestead act, how is this relevant', and I'd just like to add that the USA is Native land. All of it. All of this continent was occupied by Indigenous people who stewarded the native plants and animals. It is not up to Hannah and Daniel alone to make up for this dark history, but, at the very least, they should not disregard/disassociate the dark history attached to their aesthetic and portrayed lifestyle. \n\nThe lifestyle they romanticize is not going to solve society’s issues like many of their followers like to believe. Being a farmer doesn’t include having the traditional European gender roles and beliefs that they hold. If society at large were to regress (and yes, I choose that word intentionally) to their belief system and style of ‘stewarding the land’, that would be an act of neo-colonialism (IN MY OPINION). \n\n**Farm-to-table and 'knowing where your food comes from' is not exactly sustainable, economically or ecologically.**\n\nEveryone to some extent knows the American food system is not reliable in its current state. Even the USDA knows this, which is why they make grants available for conventional farmers/ranchers to make the switch to less ecologically harmful practices. We're losing topsoil in the United States like there's no tomorrow. There are many reasons why this is happening. Topsoil creation/preservation is a huge topic currently in ag communities and the USDA. Part of the reason this is happening is because of over-grazing, and soil compaction caused by unsustainably ranching cattle. The videos Hannah posts showing off their land kills my soul. All of the grassy fields they have used to be habitat. Grasses have a shallow root system (Which promotes compaction of soil)  and are not nutrient dense. Having that much grass for literally no reason other than aesthetic purposes/lack of knowing how plants work is so incredibly fucking harmful to our ecosystems. You need healthy ecosystems in order to produce food. I'm approaching farm-snark territory right now (new term just dropped), but, having 300 acres to practice systems of farming that are recognized as harmful is certainly a choice. Using lots of land to produce mainly one agricultural product is also called monocropping. That term mainly applies to plant-based crops, however, they still SEVERELY reduced the genetic diversity of a whopping 300 acres with all of that grass and cow patties. Think about all of the carbon sequestration that occurred on that 300 acres before it was clear-cut and grazed for cows.\n\nSo don't think of farm-to-table or knowing where your food comes from as beating the American food system. It means nothing if the farm you’re buying from is contributing toward desecrating the land. Farm-to-table in theory is great, but it’s also not part of the solution to our food system collapsing. \n\nFood scarcity is a scary thought that many people think about, for good reason. But don't be fooled by their marketing. Expensive farm-to-table produce cannot and should not alleviate your anxiety. Farm-to-table doesn't mean shit if they're farming on borrowed time/resources (Which they are, in my humble opinion). Don't even get me started about raw milk.\n\n**Lastly, their interpretation of farming is cute, but migrant farmworkers are still producing a majority of America's food. Ballerina Farm/ their copycats are not going to change that.**\n\nSupport United Farmworkers instead! Or some of these fabulous organizations:\n\nAmerican Farmland Trust (They provided my stats about farmland loss)\n\nYoung Farmer's Coalition (They largely support BIPOC Farmers and advocate for equity focused goals in the Farm Bills)\n\nNative Land Loss due to Settler Farms and Homesteads:\n\n[https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/homesteading/map/text/dispossession](https://dsl.richmond.edu/panorama/homesteading/map/text/dispossession)\n\nIf you have any questions about some of BF's farm practices or generally related questions I'll do my best to answer below.

Rare photos capture daily life in the Thumb. \\nThe early 20th century was a period of growth and change for rural towns across Michigan’s Thumb. Among them, Ubly stood out as a community shaped by farming, small-scale industry, and strong traditions. The history of Ubly, Michigan, during this era reflects the values, innovation, and cultural life of the people who called it home.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Railroad Connection: Ubly’s Link to the Outside World\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the turn of the century, the Pere Marquette Railroad depot in Ubly served as the community’s most important connection to the wider world. Farmers brought wagons full of sugar beets, grain, and dairy to the depot, where goods were loaded for shipment to Detroit and other markets.\\n\\nThe depot was more than a shipping hub. It was a gathering place where neighbors met, checked the time by the station clock, and swapped news with travelers. In a rural community like Ubly, the depot symbolized both progress and opportunity.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndustry Comes to Town\\n\\n\\n\\nUbly’s growth was tied to agriculture, but industry quickly followed.

Rare photos capture daily life in the Thumb. \\nThe early 20th century was a period of growth and change for rural towns across Michigan’s Thumb. Among them, Ubly stood out as a community shaped by farming, small-scale industry, and strong traditions. The history of Ubly, Michigan, during this era reflects the values, innovation, and cultural life of the people who called it home.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Railroad Connection: Ubly’s Link to the Outside World\\n\\n\\n\\nAt the turn of the century, the Pere Marquette Railroad depot in Ubly served as the community’s most important connection to the wider world. Farmers brought wagons full of sugar beets, grain, and dairy to the depot, where goods were loaded for shipment to Detroit and other markets.\\n\\nThe depot was more than a shipping hub. It was a gathering place where neighbors met, checked the time by the station clock, and swapped news with travelers. In a rural community like Ubly, the depot symbolized both progress and opportunity.\\n\\n\\n\\nIndustry Comes to Town\\n\\n\\n\\nUbly’s growth was tied to agriculture, but industry quickly followed.

Hobby farms are a favored option for individuals who are enthusiastic about nurturing their own produce, raising animals, and embracing a more independent way of life. Nonetheless, locating and procuring the ideal hobby farm can seem like a daunting challenge, particularly for those new to the realm of agriculture and rural real estate. In the subsequent text, we will furnish you with valuable guidance for spotting and acquiring hobby farms for sale in your vicinity.1. Establish Your Aspirations and RequirementsPrior to initiating the quest for a hobby farm, it is imperative to define your aspirations and requirements. What are your motives for desiring farm ownership? Is your interest directed towards cultivating organic vegetables, rearing animals for meat, or operating a small-scale agritourism venture? What amount of land is necessary to realize your aspirations? Do you have any explicit criteria for the farm's location, such as proximity to educational institutions, medical amenities, or major thoroughfares? By elucidating your aspirations and requirements, you can streamline your search and concentrate on properties that align with your desires.2. Investigate Local Zoning and Land Utilization RegulationsOnce you have a lucid conception of your expectations from a hobby farm, it is time to acquaint yourself with local zoning and land utilization regulations. In various regions, there exist specific regulations governing the types of activities permissible on agricultural land. For instance, certain areas may impose constraints on the quantity and category of animals that can be harbored on a property, or the dimensions and category of structures that can be erected. By familiarizing yourself with local regulations, you can avoid acquiring a property ill-suited for your proposed usage.3. Collaborate with a Real Estate Agent Specializing in Farming Real EstateWhen it comes to exploring and procuring a hobby farm, it is imperative to collaborate with a real estate agent possessing expertise in rural and agricultural properties. A knowledgeable agent can assist you in navigating the intricacies of purchasing rural real estate, including understanding soil composition, water entitlements, and access to public services. They can also facilitate the discovery of unlisted properties and negotiate a fair price on your behalf.4. Assess the Location and ReachabilityThe location of a hobby farm constitutes a fundamental aspect to contemplate. Ideally, the farm should be situated in a serene and picturesque rural setting while remaining accessible to indispensable services and amenities. Consider factors such as proximity to major thoroughfares, educational institutions, medical facilities, and farming supply outlets. It is also pivotal to evaluate the accessibility of the property, including the condition of the roads leading to the farm and the proximity to the nearest town or city.5. Evaluate the Land QualityThe quality of the land represents another pivotal consideration when procuring a hobby farm. The fertility of the soil, the presence of water sources, and the topography of the land can substantially influence the success of your farming endeavors. If crop cultivation is on your agenda, it is advisable to select a property with well-draining, fertile soil. For animal husbandry, ensuring that the land can support pasture and grazing is essential. It is also vital to evaluate the existence of any natural features, such as wetlands or woodlands, and discern how they might impact your plans for the property.6. Scrutinize the Infrastructure and InstallationsPrior to finalizing the acquisition of a hobby farm, it is paramount to scrutinize the existing infrastructure and installations on the property. This encompasses evaluating the condition of any extant structures, such as barns, storage sheds, or animal shelters. Consideration should also be given to the availability and state of utilities, such as electricity, water, and septic systems. If the property lacks indispensable infrastructure, the cost of improvements should be factored in when determining the overall investment.7. Grasp the Financial RamificationsOwning and operating a hobby farm can be a gratifying endeavor, but it also entails substantial financial implications. Prior to acquiring a farm, it is crucial to acquire a lucid comprehension of the financial obligations involved, such as property taxes, insurance, upkeep, and ongoing operational expenses. It is also prudent to contemplate the potential income-generating opportunities offered by the farm, such as vending produce, livestock, or value-added goods.8. Solicit Professional GuidanceProcuring a hobby farm constitutes a significant investment, warranting the essential step of seeking professional counsel prior to making a purchase. It is advisable to seek counsel from a legal expert, accountant, or agricultural specialist to ensure a comprehensive understanding of all the legal and financial ramifications associated with farm ownership. Seeking insights from other hobby farmers, who can provide experiential wisdom, may also be beneficial.9. Exercise Patience and DeliberationDiscovering and acquiring the ideal hobby farm is not a process to be rushed. It is imperative to exercise patience and deliberation, as the right property may not surface on the market immediately. Prepare to invest time in researching diverse properties, visiting potential farms, and appraising their suitability for your requirements. By adopting a methodical and patient approach to your search, the chances of discovering a hobby farm that aligns with your expectations are heightened.10. Prepare for the FoothillsOwning a hobby farm can be an immensely rewarding journey, but it is accompanied by its share of challenges. From capricious weather patterns to the demands of farm work, it is vital to be prepared for the realities of farm life. Maintaining realistic expectations and being prepared to invest the requisite hard work are pivotal to ensuring the success of your hobby farm.ConclusionDiscovering and procuring a hobby farm necessitates meticulous consideration of your aspirations, requirements, and the pragmatic aspects of farm ownership. By diligently researching properties, seeking professional guidance, and exercising patience in your quest, you can enhance the likelihood of discovering a hobby farm ideally suited to you. With the right approach and a clear vision for your farming pursuits, owning a hobby farm can evolve into a gratifying and enriching odyssey.

Given that this was an unexpected scenario, one must assume that they bought soybeans from places like Argentina and Brazil which were scheduled to be sent to somewhere else. China bought about 70% of their crop last year, so I guess they upped it to … 90% now?  This means there’s all these other markets which wanted soybeans that now have no soybeans. Then there’s a bunch of Americans with soybeans they need to sell. Those sound like two problems which solve each other. \n\nEven though the logistics systems were set up to send them to China, I would assume that once you get the soybeans to a port and load them onto a ship, you’re 90% of the way to anywhere. If you need to load them onto five different ships to go to smaller markets as opposed to one ship to go to a larger market, that’s a solvable problem. If those smaller markets can’t pay as much as China, which is why Argentina and Brazil dumped them in favour of it, along with the additional logistics issues mean that the Americans are only getting 50 cents on the dollar for their crop, that’s still better than getting zero for it by having that crop rot in a silo. \n\nThere seems to be some fundamental piece of the equation that I’m missing here.

The DOE subsequently [disbanded that group](https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/10/climate/trump-dissolves-contrarian-group) when faced with [a lawsuit](https://library.edf.org/AssetLink/0kdlw6oq5v8hsvj152eqx01b0qn74uuq.pdf) alleging that it violated a law requiring that such federal advisory committees must be transparent and unbiased.” \n\nUnforunately, the Environmental Protection Agency cited the DOE report [in a proposal to reverse its Obama-era determination](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/08/the-republican-campaign-to-stop-the-u-s-epa-from-protecting-the-climate/) that carbon pollution poses a threat to public health and welfare. “In response to the DOE report, a group of [85 climate experts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PwAR8I9YYmPhbQ6CRekHkroJGMbjbX7l/view) and [the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine](https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/29239/effects-of-human-caused-greenhouse-gas-emissions-on-us-climate-health-and-welfare) each published comprehensive reviews of the scientific literature and…found that rather than boosting agricultural productivity, the body of scientific evidence indicates that increased extreme weather resulting from climate change will instead reduce crop yields, making food more expensive.” Rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere trap extra heat like a blanket, [causing more frequent extreme weather](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2024/10/climate-change-made-hurricane-helene-and-other-2024-disasters-more-damaging-scientists-find/) like heat waves, droughts, and floods, which stress plants and hamper their growth and productivity. It is estimated that each additional 1°C of global warming in 2100 will reduce crop yields by the equivalent of 4.4% of each person on Earth’s recommended daily calorie intake. Many staple crops, such as wheat, corn, and soybeans, will see significant yield declines. \n\n“[Another 2025 study](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41561-025-01724-1) found that thanks to more efficient farming practices, the amount of global land devoted to agriculture could have decreased 2% over the past 30 years—while growing the same amount of food. “Instead, global croplands expanded by nearly 4% during that time because climate change slowed the growth in agricultural productivity.” The paper suggested those climate impacts caused over 200 million acres of land to be converted to cropland—twice the area of California. “It’s a vicious cycle – climate change reduces agricultural yields, which forces farmers to convert more forests to cropland, which adds more carbon to the atmosphere and worsens climate change.” The constant prevarications of the DOE are vicious as well.

September imports increased by 4.8% compared to August, according to the data.\n\nThe majority of September’s soybean imports are believed to have originated from Brazil, the world’s largest exporter. According to data from Brazilian grain exporter group Anec, China imported 6.5 million tons from Brazil in September, accounting for 93% of Brazil’s total soybean exports.\n\nIn late September, Beijing secured a considerable quantity of Argentine soybeans, with most shipments scheduled for later this year, effectively sidelining U.S. farmers during their crucial marketing period.\n\nChina has not bought any U.S. soybean shipments from this autumn’s harvest.

We inherited a 3,000 m² vineyard (abandoned for about 20 years) in the Hérault region of southern France. We’re toying with the idea of planting pistachio trees as a small-scale trial project in 2026.\n\n**Our situation:**\n- The land has been fallow for decades, with a small outbuilding on site.\n- No direct water access for irrigation (we know this is a major challenge…).\n- Soil is likely clay-limestone, typical of the Mediterranean, but we haven’t tested it yet. Surrounding farms are wineries and olive trees.\n- We’re starting from scratch: zero experience in gardening or fruit tree cultivation.\n\n**Our questions:**\n- Where should we begin? Should we start with soil analysis, clearing the land, or something else?\n- Is pistachio suitable for our dry Mediterranean climate? If so, which varieties are best?\n- How can we work around the irrigation issue? Are there water-saving techniques or realistic alternatives?\n- What are the biggest pitfalls for beginners to avoid?\n- Do you have any resources (guides, local associations, personal experiences) to help us learn without getting overwhelmed?\n\nWe’re not aiming for commercial production, just hoping to bring this land back to life and learn along the way. Maybe extend to other plots later if we are successful. If anyone has tried growing pistachios in southern Europe or has advice for Mediterranean climates, we’d love to hear from you!\n\nThanks in advance for your help, and apologies if these questions are too basic.

Faut-il d’abord faire analyser le sol, nettoyer le terrain, ou autre chose ?\n- La pistache est-elle adaptée à notre climat ?

I am a TERRIBLE student can't sit still or pay attention to save my life so I had written off careers that involve that as I would not be able to sit for the amount of time required to get a degree. I have been inclined towards agriculture for many reasons, but largely as I hoped not to attend school again. Now that I'm working on farms, I see there is an incredible amount to learn and am wondering if I'm an idiot for considering school once again (again, an atrocious student) These programs seem hands on and applicable so I could have a chance in them although this is all a new world to me. \nThe program I'm looking at is Agriculture management or business, and I'm trying to decide between the U of A program, U of S, or Olds College. If I was to take any of these, would the initial 2-3 years be enough or would I have to go on? Im trying to get a good read if this is a waste of time or not. And if these programs are a waste of time, what do you suggest I should do instead? I dont have anyone I can ask for advice except the farmers I've been working with and they took these programs 50 years ago so I'm wanting to make sure considering something thats still applicable and useful. I'm leaning into Olds College Agriculture program the most, is it still the best? Any advice from some Canadian farmers would be greatly appreciated.\nThanks so much in advance!

But once the deal closed in 2018, a California jury awarded $289M in the first Roundup cancer trial.\n\nMore massive verdicts followed, and Bayer’s reassurances about risk management started to look questionable (at least, lol). \n\nAfter all of this happened, $BAYRY plunged 11%, and investors filed a lawsuit claiming that the company ignored the potential cost of the Roundup situation and hid key info from shareholders ahead of one of the largest acquisitions in pharma-agriculture history.\n\nNow, Bayer has finally agreed to a $38M payout to resolve the claims, and the court just approved the settlement. So if you invested back then, you can check the details and [file a claim](https://11th.com/cases/bayer-investor-settlement) to get payment.\n\nAnyways, did you have trusted Bayer’s DD at the time, or did the risks always seem obvious to you?",,,reddit,2025-09-20T01:23:59.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agriculture/comments/1nldo3n/bayer_agreed_to_settle_with_investors_over/,,-0.4549,Agriculture,15,2,1nldo3n,Bayer Agreed to Settle With Investors Over Monsanto Deal and the Court Approved It,,,,,,,,

It’s goal is to undermine financial protections and market opportunities for rural farmers with the goal of  eliminating the Agricultural Risk Coverage and Price Loss Coverage programs, which shield farmers from sharp declines in crop prices and lost revenues. It would also prohibit farmers from receiving ARC/PLC payments in the same year as crop insurance indemnities, hindering their ability to finance the next planting season. Which makes sense if the real estate developer president pals would be buying up these farms.  Additionally, the plan would restrict access to Farm Service Agency loans, making it harder for small and family farmers to secure capital for operations or expansion. Finally, it proposes cutting crop export promotion programs, such as the Market Access Program and Foreign Market Development \n\nAgain, the author of project 2025 has propose to eliminate ARC and PLC, restrict FSA loans, and cut export promotion programs align with republican broader goals of reducing government intervention and federal spending, which are recurring themes in the document’s agricultural and economic policy sections and coincidentally align with Trump tariff effectively eliminating rural farmers foreign clientele.

We have always had barn cats on the property at our house and they are well fed and taken care of. Recently my father inherited land from a relative that passed away and brought animals to live on the pasture land there. There is a large barn on this property as well. This past year my father has brought in many cats to take care of mice or other critters in the barn. It has certainly helped deter pests. However, I’ve noticed my dad does not visit and feed the cats often enough. Multiple cats have disappeared and died over the year and it is making me very upset that he continues to bring in new ones. Currently there is only one cat left and she is extremely skinny, I think the other cat that was most recently with her may have passed from starvation or found a way out to get other food. There is poor ventilation and a lack of food. I want to take the cat away to my college house so that she can live a safer life. I know that my father will probably be mad at me taking away the cat only because he cares about keeping mice out. Please give me any advice on the situation, but mainly I would like to know other ways of keeping rodents out of a barn than cats so that I can give him an alternative and hopefully stop him from hurting any more cats due to neglect and not visiting the property.

This kind of AgTech innovation in general is what propels society forward and could possibly eliminate problems that have withstood the test of time. \n\nHowever, out of curiosity, the big question I have is how to think about the cost curve in this kind of business. For example if it costs $3 to grow a lb. of tomatoes and you can sell it for $2 right now, that’s obviously not a good business. But where does that $3 go over time as these processes become more efficient and scale kicks in?\n\nAlso, when it comes to creating tech to pick tomatoes and maintain a high-tech facility, I imagine some costs become fixed, but I am in the dark as to how easy/difficult it is to trim costs to improve margins.

I have formed a theory that, like humans, ruminant fecal matter is saturated with digestive enzymes and spent protein. The further packing of the manure with protein should continue the digestive process and make the manure amino rich. This should aid plant life in speed of growth. \n\n**Results**\n\n* Slight light-bending vapor upon contact of selected vehicle (mostly vinegar) and protein\n* Smell returned to expected “farm smell” upon introduction of water\n* To be assessed on 10/29/2018 at 22:00\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThis is very different than current assumption in farming in that manures are beneficial in most forms, Whereas I contend that they are little more than nutrient deposits from earlier digestion if the manures are dried or thinned with water: the predominant use of the material today. However, these processes kill the digestive enzymes that run amino cultivation.",,,reddit,2018-10-23T07:34:56.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/agtech/comments/9qkifg/currently_testing_a_new_aminorich_manure/,,0.5308,agtech,1,0,9qkifg,Currently Testing a New Amino-Rich Manure,,,,,,,,

Would it be ok if I left the plant in the soil in that pot for the 1 week until Christmas? If so, I'm assuming I'd need a plant saucer to place underneath. 2) When it arrives, I'm assuming it will come with care instructions, but should I water it immediately?

When I gaze at it, I feel like I could just lose myself in dreams. This plant has been a labor of love for quite some time. I chose a local rootstock with strong immunity that’s well-suited to our environment, ensuring it’s disease-resistant and blooms abundantly. On this rootstock, I carefully grafted six different chili bougainvillea colors from around the world. Alhamdulillah, the grafts took successfully, and now it blooms year-round, making my balcony feel like a dreamy little garden oasis.\n\nPlease excuse a bit of background noise in the video. I hope you can enjoy the beauty of the plant and the moment nonetheless!

I made a 45 degree clean cut with a cleaned and sanitized pair of scissors just above the third set of leaves. I decided that the bottom half is Leona and the top half is Calliope. Those are the two names for them that I decided to go with. Twin mints. I know that clones are technically not the same thing as identical siblings but it is technically not too far off though since identical twins tend to share the majority of their DNA. Also, should I put the mint cutting away from my light source or in the same location? I heard mixed reports that it is actually a bad idea to do so right away due to how the developing roots will react to the sunlight. Please correct me if any of this information is wrong. While I initially got the mint plant from a cutting outside in my garden in the past, this is my very first time doing it on an indoor mint. I basically played plant surgeon lol. All jokes aside, the cut is very clean and precise. No signs of stress either as I was very delicate with the mint plant while doing this. I held the pot it was in from the bottom to keep it steady. I am very happy with the current results. Now all I have to do is water Leona at regular intervals and let Calliope develop some roots in water.

It eventually recovered but has been on the struggle bus ever since. It used to have 4 tall stalks with several leaves but this year all of the leaves on those eventually browned, withered, and fell off. I tried repotting in a pot with better drainage, and the soil is a looser palm/citrus mix soil. I don't see any obvious pests like mealybugs or spider mites (although I have treated for both of those in the past). Approximately 1.5 months ago, I noticed one new sprout coming up with healthy looking leaves, and decided to prune the other dead stalks as to avoid attracting pests. It was doing very well and getting taller until a week ago when the leaves starting withering and getting spotty including the new leaf growth (which isn't as perky). I have no idea what's been plaguing the poor guy. It sits in an area with partial shade and gets mid-morning sun.

This is the weirdest thing I have ever seen.\n\nSo, I have two questions—\n\n(1) Is there any healthy fungicide out there— like the neem oil I'm using for insects— that I could just spray the plants down with, without having to worry about it injuring/killing them if I don't quickly remove it, unlike the vinegar?\n\n(2) What on earth is going on with these two appletrees crooking to the side like this?

I found a runner growing from underneath a fence and took it home with me when I noticed it had roots in April/May. I’m very new to this, so I don’t know a lot about strawberry plants, but I feel like something weird is going on? Normally, the plant consistently pushes three leaved stems from the centre of the plant one at a time, but for about two weeks now, they haven’t grown beyond the dense region at the base of the plant. When I’m looking over the plant, and inspecting the crazy runner that exploded to life within three days, I noticed black matter, which looks similar to seeds. I couldn’t tell if there was petals at some point or just thin dry leaves. I do believe it is growing flowers, there are now many small buds growing at the base of the plant, but why is it happening in this way? Is it normal for the growth to stay so densely packed at the base, especially when it only took a couple of days for a stem with leaves to grow to a normal length before?

At the spring head the end of the pipe is lower than the first part of the run as it enters the spring reservoir.\n\nSo my assumption is this is actually acting as a siphon.\n\nOriginally there was a pump at the house end connected directly to the end of the pipe and that pump fed the house. We didn't have any issues with the water stopping but the flow rate/pressure was limited by how much water the pump could suck out of the pipe and it also sucked a bunch of air so would switch off sometimes.\n\nSo we put a header tank on the end of the spring feed and now the pump pulls from that...great flow and pressure now. But now the air builds up in the line from the spring I am assuming and kills the siphon eventually.\n\nI put one of these air release valves at the high point at he spring head...primed the line with a submersible pump.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/y0lo492q0n5g1.jpg?width=284&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=19762baea09a9f16f304a529f0e44cf174b646e7\n\n  \n\n\nWhen I switch off the pump the siphon doesn't continue.

I purchased 2 of them for under 1,500 USD. Every county has different outreach programs so you have to call your specific county to get information. \n\nI'm gonna give you the way I do for finding properties. \n\n1. Get the address \n\n2. Do a basic search online for the address and see if it's listed on any popular sites. \n\n3. Find out the county and get the townships court house. \n\n4. Call the courthouse and ask for the clerk of courts, give them the address and see the active status. \n\n5. They will tell you if the property is for sale, if it has been taken by the county, or weather someone's living in it. \n\n6. Ask about zoning. It's very important to ask what the property is zoned for. Also you need to find out of there's any easements on the property. Say they had to run a sewer line, there may be a line from another property if they do have a easement. So it's very important to ask this. \n\n7. Pay to have a title search done if it's from a private seller. It's worth it to do right away and can save you time because you don't want to deal with anything that may obstruct the deal. Like a loan lean or something like that. \n\nWrite everything down, this way you're not scrambling to as questions when you have to call different departments. Wrote your question down as well. \n\nAfter doing some research on the property you are interested in, go there. You always want to see the property first hand. But I did get lucky in Florida. A lady from. Facebook group drove by the property and sent me pictures and videos. I saw the video and bought it right away. \n\nAlways make sure you do a lot of research on the property. Ask about easements if you have close neighbors, zoning and any that may not let you build or do what you want without being harassed by the code enforcement. \n\nKnow what type of sewage and drainage system that you are required to have in the county where you are. Some may just require a septic system that also. So make sure you ask when you call the courthouse. \n\nI'm sure I'm missing a few things. But ever since I have found out about this. I search different areas all the time. I have 2 in Ohio and 1 in Florida. \n\nThe one in Florida I'm going to plant orange trees and other fruits and vegetables. I recently bought a drip irrigation system with a Bluetooth timer that I'm gonna install on the property. \n\nThe 2 in Ohio I'm going to put mobile homes on them and flip them as well. One is .44 acres and has a stream flowing through it. As soon as I seen that , I decided I was buying it. It's about 1.5 hours from me, but it's very secluded in a small town that I never even knew existed. \n\nThis video is the one in Florida. I planned on doing a voice over. But I have to do it later and will remove this video. \n\nIf you have any questions just ask me. \n\nI just wish there were baby alligators living in that pond. Trust me I looked, but there was only baby frogs and fish. ",,,reddit,2025-12-07T00:20:39.000Z,https://youtu.be/pPCGzLNUkI0,,0.4142,homestead,0,1,1pfwsri,Buying backed taxed property,,,,,,,,

A bobcat roared to life, its engine singing the hymn of progress. I stood upon the earth, radiant with ambition, my heart fluttering like a delicate Victorian maiden reading forbidden literature. The rabbit grounds were to be transformed, sculpted into the very foundation of my dreams.\n\nBut fate, cruel and capricious, had other designs.\n\nWithout warning, from the very bowels of the accursed earth, a swarm of feral bees burst forth like the anguished souls of the damned. The operator was swallowed in a vortex of wings and stings, a tragic hero felled in the line of duty. My beloved, brave but mortal, suffered stings as he attempted to flee. And I, delicate of constitution and fragile of airway, was forced to retreat indoors clutching my chest like a consumptive heroine who has just read a distressing telegram.\n\nEven now, the bees reign supreme over the rabbit area, patrolling their ill-gotten kingdom with tyrannical zeal. No mortal may pass. No dream may flourish. The land is theirs, and I am but a mournful widow wandering the corridors of despair, whispering prayers into the cold, indifferent wind.\n\nMy soul has collapsed like a dying star. My hopes lie strewn across the homestead like wilted roses at the grave of my sanity. The bobcat stands abandoned, a hero turned statue, gazing hollowly at the battlefield where the bees claimed victory.\n\nTruly, I have become a Dickensian orphan cast to the wolves of fate, crying into the void for mercy. But the void answers only with buzzing.\n\nI shall now sit upon my fainting couch, stare mournfully out the window, and await the beekeeper, who arrives as either saviour or sacrifice. Should I perish before his arrival, let it be known that the bees struck first.\n\nPray for my strength\nPray for my rabbits\nPray for Legacy Ridge\n\nBut most importantly\nPray for the beekeeper\n\nFor he enters a war from which many do not return.\n\n\nPhotos attached to show the space that will one day become my rabbit area but for now remains occupied by a swarm of angry bees.

Our property is mostly wooded (primarily oak) with one lot being 10 acres of undeveloped land and the other \~5 acres where our house and barn are. \n\n* The yellow circled area is the \~2 acres that are mostly cleared surrounding the house. \n* The blacked out lines are the roads. Main road runs across the bottom of this pic, the other two running vertically are private dirt roads. \n* The red area is \~5 acre lot our neighbor owns.\n* The blue line is the lot line between our 5 and 10 acres. \n* The pink star is around the area we're thinking about building our ""dream home"" someday. \n* The grey line is our \~ 500ft long driveway.\n\nWhen we moved here I had a push mower and walk behind snowblower, so I picked up a used '04 (I think) Troy-Bilt Pony/Bronco (not sure which), with two mower decks, a snowblower and a bunch of extra parts. It's *worked* alright, but I keep running into situations where it feels like it's just not quite up to snuff. The snowblower bogs down on my snow and I end up spending all day working on clearing snow and unclogging the auger. Or the insane amount of leaves end up piling up and jamming in my mower deck's belts. Parts breaking that I then can't find replacements for. etc...\n\nIt seems like part of the problem is that the guy I bought it from was a little bit of an ""innovator"", and I'm not even 100% sure that everything that came with/on this thing is meant to. \n\nBasically, where I feel I'm at is that I have 3 options: \n\n1. I pour a bunch of time and effort (and probably money) into getting this thing fixed up and running like new.\n2. I get rid of it and replace it with a new ""garden tractor"" in the same class. \n3. I upgrade.\n\nOption 1, is pretty much out of the running because I'm a new dad for the first time twice over this year so I don't have the time to add another project. \n\nOption 2, feels like it's probably the ""smart"" and economical choice. But I worry that I'm still going to be fighting the issues I've had with belts slipping and feeling like it's underpowered for things I need.\n\nSo I'm leaning option 3, but I have next to no knowledge on these things. I have no clue how much I actually need. From my minimal research, I *think* I want to get a subcompact or compact tractor. I'm leaning toward Kubota, and they've got some good financing options available through the end of the year. I can compare features and HP amounts, but have no real world understanding of what any of it really means. Any advice on what to get? \n\nMy main uses would be mowing the 1.5-2 acres of grass (and acorns &amp; oak leaves) around the house and clearing my driveway of snow. Occasional use would/could include clearing some thicker brush in some areas, possibly digging up a garden plot (would probably rent implements if that's a thing), clearing an area to build our new house eventually and just other random landscaping needs.",,,reddit,2025-12-06T11:38:44.000Z,https://i.redd.it/zdfpscucoi5g1.jpeg,,-0.5,homestead,11,23,1pfi2ty,How much tractor do I REALLY need?,,,,,,,,

It will be as sturdy and durable as any full size steel building. While technically portable, it will require a truck or tractor to drag. Or it can be winched onto a trailer. \n\nI’m curious if there might be a market for the manufacture and sale of these calf huts. Im on the Oklahoma Texas line and I haven’t been able to find anything comparable for sale. \nThe size of these was determined by my trailer, but I can make any size short of becoming an oversize load. Any of the standard metal building color schemes are available, I can install gates across the front, possibly vents, etc. I can market simpler versions in galvanized steel, or I can market a color matched, extra trim version to the bougie homestead crowd. \n\nThe only potential hang up is the cost.

The nearest US equivalent in  altitude and latitude is probably Amarillo Texas (most years our rainfall would be about 30% higher, but not this year - like much of Australia, we have extreme year-to-year variance). \n\nThe side of a mountain means large liner tanks are infeasible, so we have around a dozen tanks ranging from 500 to 5000 gallons (2000 to 22000 litres) where we can find or create flat ground (plus quite a few Intermediate Bulk Carriers). The most fire critical tanks are gal, the rest are poly for cost. Two have needed their roofs repaired due to UV, so I need a solution. \n\nI've previously tried painting an IBC; didn't really work so I don't think it's a solution, especially for the larger tanks. Apart from anything else, I'd be on my own if the roof gave way while I was painting... I've also tried Chinese pool covers. Working beautifully for IBCs. I'd strongly recommend them. Not so much for the larger tanks, the wind ripped them to shreds.\n\nSo I'm looking at shade cloth and hoping for advice from anyone who's tried it. I'm guessing 90% shade cloth might have too much wind resistance, so maybe 80%? The design I'm thinking for the largest tanks (3.3 m diameter) is a 3.6m X 5m sheet, run rope along the two long sides, drape them over the top with the extra length facing North (sunny) side, peg the ropes down (\_very\_ securely), then run further ropes East and West from the main ropes to prevent the shade cloth riding up into the middle. Does this make sense? Anyone have any experience with anything similar? If the description is too hard to follow I can probably manage a hand-drawn plan, but it's definitely not my forte.\n\nThanks for any advice\n\nBob\n\n",,,reddit,2025-12-06T03:11:47.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1pf7knw/preserving_polytanks/,,-0.5327,homestead,4,3,1pf7knw,Preserving polytanks,,,,,,,,

The other one has very little interest in them outside of how cute they are. \n\nWe built big gardens that would’ve been manageable for two people, but a lot of stuff went to waste because only one of us ended up doing most of the work outside of making the garden look cute. \n\n“We” wanted to live off grid as much as possible one of us actually enjoys the well water, even though it’s softened, without filtering it through a Britta or something similar. \n\n“We” want to get bees and tap our maple trees but I’m concerned that I’ll be doing all the work again. \n\nThese are just some relatively light examples, but it’s starting to feel like I’m living with someone who wants to live the Homestead lifestyle without actually living the homestead lifestyle. \n\nI’m not asking for advice or  “talk to your partner” I’m just asking if anyone has had a similar experience. \n\n**y’all I know what the answers are.

Right now my composting set-up is basic (or amateurish). I have one of those black cylindrical composting bins that I toss my veggie scraps into during the warm months. Come spring, I take whatever is in there and dig it into my garden beds, usually a mixture of partially and fully composting material. I've been doing some reading into upgrading my set up and I plan on building a 3 bin system (i.e. having 3 ongoing compost piles so that each has three years to fully compost), but I have two questions.\n\nFirstly, I understand compost should be an even mix of 'greens' and 'browns'. While I have plenty of 'greens' (garden waste, food scraps etc) I don't have a ready source of 'browns'. I don't have much in the way of trees for leaves and wood scraps. I suppose I could toss some newspaper in but certainly not half a pile worth. What are others doing for this? Am I overthinking it?\n\nSecondly, what are people doing in the winter? Temperatures are freezing between about November and March, and I'm worried that tossing veggie scraps on top of snow will be a recipe for attracting pests rather than making beautiful compost. Right now all the excess is destined for the landfill, am I doing this wrong?\n\nThanks in advance for your thoughts.",,,reddit,2025-12-03T22:11:09.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1pd977z/composting_tips_needed_browns_and_winter/,,0.5166,homestead,5,5,1pd977z,Composting tips needed - 'browns' and winter composting,,,,,,,,

Off-grid dwellers buy enormous amounts of supplies. None of us are making our own solar panels and batteries. Does off-grid mean growing a large percentage of your own food, providing your own electrical and water, heating with a wood stove, or possibly all of the above and more? Is the internet part of the grid?\n\nOnce we agree on exactly what we are talking about when we say off grid, then I have to ask what the motivation is.\n\nI understand off-grid gives you access to more rural locations. Some of us want to live in the middle of the desert or on a mountain top. Is there any other reason besides location to voluntarily choose to be off grid?\n\nI don't think the appeal could be cost savings, off grid can be a pricy choice. Is it the sense of independence? Of freeing oneself from the shackles of society? \n\nIs it a concern for the continued stability of society? This is certainly a concern that I share, and I have backup plans in place, but I'm more than happy to use society's water and society's electricity while waiting for the world to end.\n\nThis is been a question that's been brewing in my mind for some time now, why do so many people say they want to be off grid. Do they equate it with being cost free? Do they want to live miles away from any neighbors? Is it a quest for self-sufficiency so they don't have to depend on the vagaries of society?",,,reddit,2025-12-03T07:46:16.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1pcrwfq/why_off_grid/,,-0.4249,homestead,63,73,1pcrwfq,Why off grid?,,,,,,,,

She had been losing weight over the past month and had laid down on Saturday and did not get back up. As the neighbour has too many other cows to take care of, he has offered to give us the orphan calf, who is underweight and just about 5 months old. We suspect he is underweight as he has not been able to nurse from his mom in the past few weeks with her being sick.\n\nWe have horses, chickens and other various animals so we are not completely new to animals, but are relatively new to cattle. We have hay for the winter, and have an enclosed pen with a lean-to. Our biggest concern right now is getting the little guy to a healthy weight with the start of winter (zone 4A for reference, so it does get cold). If anyone has any helpful tips, we would welcome any and all!\n\nI would also appreciate if anyone has any answers on the following:\n\n1. Do we need milk replacement for the little guy? \n\n2. Should we supplement with starter feed or grower feed at this stage? How much of this feed would he need a day? Do we just keep the feed bucket full of this until he's back to a good weight?\n\n3. Is there anything else in addition we can use to get weight on him quickly?\n\nOnce again, thank you for your assistance in this! We are hoping in a month or two we can integrate him with our horses.

The land is purchased under an LLC that I own, as I intend to use the land not only to live off of, but to generate an income for me, those who are helping, and support Van Horn. \n\nIn a perfect world I would like to invite 3-4 people with verifiable skills and workmanship (GC, HVAC, masonry, plumbing,lineman, etc)\n\nAnd I would like to have 1-2 people who have experience in farm work, homesteading skill craft (canning, gardening,preserving, etc)\n\nEach person would have a responsibility within their skillset and for some skills like gardening, canning etc I would create a separate partnership LLC that would allow for profit share.  Obviously there are potential processes that can take a while to receive proper permits and such to sell and distribute goods.\n\nIdeally anyone who came to live would need to be prepared to pay a nominal rent and utilities fee upon arrival  to pay for their share of services via some sort of “rental agreement” \n\nPeople who were just looking to for a safe place, and looking to keep their hands busy for a few weeks or months could do so if they bring their own shelter, and work for their rent. \n\nPeople who are looking to put down roots, work hard, are goal oriented and can see a vision and work towards a goal, would be welcomed to stay longer, for little to no rent after stable revenue is generated, for little to no cost. \n\nIt is important to note that at no time will you ever be offered permanent ownership, of the land, a building, or any other asset in exchange for your work. I am always open to business and other partnerships however. While I don’t intend to put a limit on a length of stay for  any person who is bringing value, I don’t want anyone to think that there is a general possibility for that to happen. Plus, it’s a pain in the butt to subdivide a parcel. \n\n\n\n\nTimeline:\n\nJanuary 5th- I arrive,first permanent building arrives. (this will be my house) \nJanuary 10th - second permanent building arrives (temporary garage/storage/solar control room) \nJanuary 15th- I will arrive and stay for 5 days, in this time I will be picking up water totes that have already been ordered, and a cheap camper trailer for general use (toilet/shower). And signing a delivery agreement with a local water delivery company. \nFeb 5th- I will arrive back with solar panels and necessary install equipment and begin installation. Water is scheduled to be delivered. \n\n\nIf this sounds like something you’re interested in legitimately. Please dm me.

One approach is shipping container farming, which involves transforming standard freight containers into controlled growing environments. Inside these units, crops are cultivated using hydroponic or aeroponic systems, supported by LED lighting and advanced climate controls. Because they are modular and mobile, these farms can operate in cities, deserts, or remote regions, producing food year-round regardless of outside conditions. Considering both the opportunities and the drawbacks. \n\nShipping container farming essentially means repurposing cargo containers into compact, climate-managed farms. Plants grow without soil, relying on nutrient-rich water or mist, while LED lights provide the energy they need and climate systems regulate temperature, humidity, and carbon dioxide. This setup makes farming possible in places where traditional agriculture is difficult, reduces transportation distances by placing farms closer to consumers, and allows continuous production. At the same time, it requires significant energy, offers limited crop diversity, and involves high upfront costs.\n\nOverall, it’s a creative solution for producing fresh greens and herbs in urban or resource-constrained settings. While it isn’t suited for large-scale staple crops, it works well as a complementary system that brings food production closer to where people live, helping improve resilience and reduce environmental impact.\n\nAssuming a realistic indoor setup, a 60ft by 8ft (Standard) container can produce roughly 110–160 kg of cherry tomatoes per month, which is about 7,000–11,000 tomatoes (at ~15 g each). This range depends heavily on layout, lighting, and cultivar.\n\nhow do you view the idea of using shipping containers as farms to grow food in a sustainable and efficient way?\n",,,reddit,2025-11-29T23:12:20.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1p9uwa5/shipping_container_farming/,,0.6661,homestead,0,7,1p9uwa5,Shipping Container farming,,,,,,,,

I'm in a region where standard Western materials like GI and high-tensile wire are either crazy expensive or just not available, so I have to get creative with what's on hand.\n\nI've attached some pics of my land to give you a better idea.\n\n* **Green lines** are my electric fence (around 1000m total).\n* **Red line** is the spring water line that feeds our house.\n* As you can see, the terrain is pretty uneven, which is causing me some headaches.\n\n# Problem 1: The Janky Electric Fence\n\nMy current setup is temporary and needs a major upgrade.\n\n* **Posts:** Scrap forest wood, driven about 1 foot into the ground.\n* **Wire:** 3 rows of positive wire. It's not high-tensile, but what's locally called ""clutch wire"" (the stuff used in 2-wheeler clutch systems). It's super cheap, but it stretches and loosens constantly, making it a pain to maintain.\n\n**My proposed upgrade:**  \nI want to replace every 3rd wooden post with something more permanent. My idea is to use a **1.5-inch mild steel (MS) angle**. Galvanized Iron (GI) is not a viable option for me due to cost and availability.\n\n* **Installation:** Drive them 3 feet into the ground, leaving 4 feet above. No concrete, and they won't be corner posts, so no bracing.\n* **Wire:** I plan to stick with the cheap clutch wire but add **inline tighteners** to manage the tension.\n\n**My Questions for you:**\n\n1. **Will untreated mild steel angles last long enough as line posts?** I'm worried about rust, especially below ground. How quickly would they fail?\n2. **Is 3 feet deep enough for a line post** on this kind of uneven ground without any bracing? I would brace 90 degree turns, but those are few.\n3. Is 2.5inch MS Pipe better than angle? I find it hard to paint on the inside.\n4. Any other tips for fencing on a budget with non-standard materials?\n\n# Problem 2: The Clogged Spring Water Line\n\nWe're lucky to have a spring, but the water is very hard (TDS is 360, measured using off the shelf TDS meter.). It currently runs through a 1.5-inch plastic pipe (the red line), and the mineral buildup blocks it regularly.  I want to bury it for protection and to keep the water cooler.\n\n**My Questions for you:**\n\n1. What's the best way to run an underground pipe over this terrain? Should I dig **under the small levees/berms** or go over them? In other words, a straight line from spring to home or straight lines and 90 degree turns (image 6).\n2. Given the hard water issue, should I upgrade to a **larger diameter pipe (like 2 inches)** when I bury it to help prevent clogging?\n3. Any other tricks for dealing with hard water in a supply line?\n\nThanks in advance for any and all suggestions! Really looking forward to hearing what you all would do in my shoes.\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/ma2a1vlggu3g1.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3f68bb180663212da20802bae1c7f1b7bf6cb805\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/nqg5afhggu3g1.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=37190eaa76d328ca86690632e5686e9aafda23b5\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/5nkpzuhggu3g1.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bbe032cb0ec323ac8424416d887e07f8de9d63b2\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/1w2ez9iggu3g1.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e3d64873357b9a73fbd59afbcb08fe04e4e4fad8\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/s51navhggu3g1.jpg?width=2016&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a29c54eeeb9feeb3853a0b08d8c4c5a094b4f800\n\nhttps://preview.redd.it/bacjxzhggu3g1.jpg?width=1217&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff5ea6b1c0dd9f4beedcb807e7217af63fd3e6b2\n\n",,,reddit,2025-11-28T00:13:11.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1p89rra/seeking_advice_upgrading_a_scrappy_electric_fence/,,0.6585,homestead,3,0,1p89rra,Seeking advice: Upgrading a scrappy electric fence &amp; spring water line on uneven terrain (pics),,,,,,,,

You can see their signature naming convention in **EnterPRIse, PRIscilla, William’s PRIde,** and **PRIma**, but they also developed **GoldRush**, **Jonafree**, and **Redfree**, which all made the Top 20.\n* **Scion vs. Rootstock:** Keep in mind this tracks the resistance of the variety itself (the scion).

We gave them permission, and communicated with them, asked where they will be, where they will be parking and so on, to make sure it's all safe. They came over and parked on our property while we we on our way out to town. Around 3pm. \n\nWe went to town to run some errands. We went to Walmart to grab some cream cheese, picked up the chainsaw from service and so on.\n\nBy the time we got back dusk was already setting in. I went to grab my rifle, Headlamp, and earmuffs as usual, and began the nightly routine of making sure all the chickens are in the coop, counting them, and locking up. It was already dark at this point. I spotted 2 glowing eyes from an Opossum looking at me from one of our old barns, probablydisappointed that it won't be getting chicken dinner tonight. and told my Significant other about it. \n\nAs I was closing the coop and locking up  a gunshot rang out, it came from over the crest of the hill, just under 100 yards away. Way too close for comfort. I looked over my shoulder where it came from and saw a flashlight pointing in my general direction, sweeping from side to side. Then I scanned with my light, I didn't see anything since it was over the hill and the flashlight switched to the complete opposite direction and swept from side to side in a violent motion, almost as if someone was running off, towards our 40 acres of forest.\n\nI saw a black pickup truck driving off past our place, but it wasn't our neighbors pickup truck. I communicated with the neighbors for camera footage.\n\n I had her call 911 for a sheriff and/or game warden. She gave a description of me, what I'm wearing and that i'm armed with a rifle. I finished locking up the coop and got the car keys, grabbed a second trauma kit and we hopped into the car. We drove towards the pasture where we thought we saw the light, by going down the driveway and up the road. We met our neighbors on the way up and let them know we heard it too and we came to check it out just like they did. We've both been hearing gunshots after dark in this area for the past few days. We both scanned the field but couldn't find anything. I drove 600 feet down into our pasture and continued scanning. We didn't find anything. Whoever it was, ran off into the woods.\n\nWe came back, told him we didn't find anything and went back home. My neighbors had already called when they heard the shot as well. One of them has a crazy ex and the sheriff already knows em. \n\nI went out and scanned for evidence, I looked for deer, wounded animals, beer cans, couldn't find anything. \n\nThe sheriff went to our neighbors first to get reports then came to us. As I heard him pull up my driveway I slung my rifle over from the front to my back and met him outside. I told him I was outside and heard exactly where it came from. I showed him where. We went together and we scanned together. He went to the woods alone and had me stand back, did the whole legal thing ""county sheriff's office! If you're in there make yourself known!"" Nothing came of that of course. \n\nThe sheriff took a report and said he'll be doing more patrolling in the area and that if we see headlights it's probably him. \n\nI went home and he went home, then me and my Significant other discussed the whole incident. Tried to rule out potential suspects. I communicated with my neighbors and let them know what the sheriff said.\n\nI called my neighbors from the other side over to see if they saw any vehicles parked on the side of the road or if they saw someone. The man of the house wasn't home, so I figured I'll call the next morning.\n\nThe next morning I got up at 5:30. I spoke on the phone with my brother a bit. Then around 6:20 I called the neighbors and asked them if they'd seen anyone or anything, that it was past dark and so on. They said it was probably them. I was like, what? Your truck wasn't parked there. It was past dark. Hunting is not legal past dark, and he was in a different spot than what he communicated with me earlier that day. Then he started to go on about something about an injured deer, looking for blood trails, finishing it off, and they got spooked by flashlights shining in their direction and ran off into the woods. Some of it was muffled and cut out so I'll need to have a conversation in person with their dad and have him talk to his boys about it. \n\nMy neighbors are also not very happy about it, it was way too close to both of our houses, and right across the street from the driveway of our other neighbors. \n\nWhen i told one of my neighbors:\n""That's ridiculous. They should know better than to go right up against peoples homes and pulls stunts like that""\n\nHow would you handle it? What would you say? We are on good terms with this neighbor and do business with them. I just want them to know what they did was not very much appreciated and that they need to hunt in another spot, and not past a certain hour. Because we genuinely believed it was not them, since we heard shots after dark the past few days from different directions and all the above mentioned. I'm disappointed and tired. \n\n",,,reddit,2025-11-21T20:46:59.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1p319vf/poachers_and_shenanigans/,,0.4769,homestead,53,32,1p319vf,Poachers and shenanigans,,,,,,,,

I seeded a cover crop mix in it soon after building, and then moved my chickens in there for the time being to scratch up the cover crop, poop everywhere, and hopefully pick out some of the weeds/seed bank.\n\nI'm planning for spring planting now. The goal is to use a good amount of the tunnel to experiment with a variety of crops, timing, etc for at least this first year, but not necessarily grow a huge amount of those things. I don't think I'll have the time/capacity to really plant all 7 of the ~90ft rows with a bunch of different things to try out, so I'm planning to plant maybe 4 of those rows with lots of just a few staple crops at a time for my family and/or to sell on the side. \n\nI think tomatoes will be a bulk of that during the summer for canning, drying, and selling. Green and dry beans/peas are on the list, including fava beans and peas in the cooler months and cowpeas when it's hotter. Kale, cabbages, Asian greens, radishes, etc are all plans for the cold months. \n\nDo you all have other suggestions for things that I can grow TONS of while I use most of my time/energy to grow smaller batches of a variety of things in the rest of the tunnel? Bonus points for any combination of easy toplant, maintain, harvest, and storage/canning/drying friendly (tho I realize not all of those are going to be applicable to a single crop at once).\n\nCover crops for different seasons when I just need something to fill the row are also appreciated. Buckwheat has been very good for me the last couple years, but other suggestions are appreciated. I'm considering okra in the real summer heat.\n\nI'm really open for whatever. We cook at home for almost every meal, we're largely vegetarian aside from meat we raise, I like to try new/interesting foods, and I love a well stocked pantry. I'm planning on some farmers markets and a roadside stand, but produce that we can store for our own use year round is top priority. Green manure, chicken feed, and things like that are also welcome.

This morning, I'm incredibly sore, and my spouse says his back desperately needs a massage.  Between us, we both worked hard on getting things cut and cleared.  I'm proud to say that around 55 large trees met their doom, and around 20 of those fallen made their way to either a woodpile for the fireplace or to the road, to be carted off and recycled into mulch.  This isn't work that's split by gender; we both wielded chainsaws, trimmed down things, put them on the trailer, and carted the mass to the road.  If my spouse, who doesn't own the property, pours his sweat and blood into the land, then it's only right that I'm out there in the broiling sun and putting in my share, as well.  The work goes quicker when two people are out there.\n\nDuring the weekend, my sister (who was staying out there in her camper) informed me that Brother and she had had a conversation, and it was now our turn to have that conversation and make sure we were all on the same page.  She and I walked the property and talked about livestock setups.  She proposed that we fence in the back pasture again, and ignore the property boundaries in favor of keeping the pasture open so the three of us could work livestock together.  She elaborated that we could go thirds on a few heads of cattle, and divvy the meat by thirds when we butcher.\n\nI had a few questions of course, mostly regarding vet costs, medicines, dewormings/parasitic treatments, emergency treatments, feed, hay, licks, etc., how we would handle the billing, and how to solve disputes or people not being able to put up their share when the times comes.  You don't just put cattle on a property, then ignore them until it's time to butcher.  Somebody's going to have to be responsible not only for the costs, but for the actual doing.  There's expenses involved, and effort, and time.  Plus we'll need a donkey or two, due to predators in close proximity that will get bold once we have farm animals.  And we're not all on the same page financially.  Out of us three, I'd be the one absorbing the extra costs should one of the others renege.  I can afford to retire and support two people, but I can't afford to retire and support two or more families.\n\nIt gave her some food for thought.  She'll be talking to Brother again to hammer out the details.  I proposed an LLC or trust with a bank account, funded equally by us all to cover expenses, as well as to hold profits when we sell extras.  I guess this is where the lawyers step in.  Good thing we know around 200 or so of them, right?\n\nBut I'm all for sharing the land and pooling resources.  We all have a better quality of life if we do things this way, and this is the way our parents, grandparents, and great grandparents did things.  But what she didn't know was that on the drive out there, my spouse and I were talking about the exact same proposal, and were hammering out details and possible pitfalls.  Great minds, right?\n\nAnother thing discussed was the garden acreage.  That's on my property, and it's fine, high land for planting.  I proposed that if one of the other sibs wanted to drop a garden there, I'm all for it, and I'll supply the water, the fertilizer, and the fencing to keep out the deer.  Heck, I might even sprout seeds if need be.  We can divvy up the garden by thirds, too, but up until we move out there, I won't be able to do the day-to-day work to upkeep it.  Thankfully, my BIL was more than happy to volunteer.  Have I mentioned that guy's the brother I wish I'd had?  Seriously, sometimes he's more attuned to how this thing works than my own brother is.  \n\nThis is fast developing into the beginnings of reviving something that supported our grandparents and great grandparents their entire lives: a communal subsistence farm.  \n\nOne last anecdote:  during cutting, I heard a noise in the thicket by the bayou. Whatever broke that branch sounded heavy, so I picked up my .45, got it at the ready, and started cautiously making my way towards the sound.  My spouse came running up, took the firearm from me, and did the checking himself.  Turned out the neighbor's horse was right on the fencerow and making a racket.  My spouse afterwards asked me why I was walking towards perceived danger.  I replied, ""If I run, whatever's in there is going to see that as a prey move and come after me.  If it sees me approaching, that gives it pause, because that's not a 'prey' action.  It may flee on its own.  My dude, what do you think I'm going to do if this happens and you're not here?  Should I cower in a corner and wait for whatever animal it is to approach?  Ha!""

My goal was to build him a small, simple tiny home so he has his own space close by.\n\nHere’s the issue:\nDinwiddie County told me that I can’t create a second dwelling without either:\n	1.	Waiting 2 years of owning the property before I can split the land into two parcels and give him his own, or\n	2.	Building the structure as a “shed”—which means no shower, otherwise they classify it as a dwelling.\n\nI’m really struggling with this. I bought this land with the dream of taking care of my family and giving my dad a peaceful place to retire. It’s frustrating that the county rules make something this simple feel impossible.\n\nSo I’m turning to Reddit:\n	•	Are there any legal workarounds for this? Like a temporary dwelling permit, family exemption, hardship accommodation, medical variance, etc.?\n	•	Has anyone been able to build a tiny home or in-law unit in Dinwiddie (or similar VA counties) without having to wait two years?\n	•	If someone did add a shower or make it livable without notifying the county, what are the realistic repercussions? (I’m not planning to break laws—I just want to understand what actually happens in the real world so I know what I’m dealing with.)\n\nI’m not trying to dodge taxes or anything. I just want my dad to be close, safe, and comfortable. This whole thing has been pretty discouraging, so any advice, personal experience, or resources would be appreciated.\n\nThanks in advance.\n",,,reddit,2025-11-18T05:01:20.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/homestead/comments/1ozw31u/i_just_want_to_build_a_tiny_home_but_the/,,0.5264,homestead,78,210,1ozw31u,I just want to build a tiny home but the government sucks,,,,,,,,

I proved that drowning is just a lack of oxygen.\nBy using high-velocity aeration to saturate the water column, I successfully grew terrestrial plants completely submerged. No soil. No trays. No gravity.\n​I call this method Weightman Volumetric Culture (WVC).\n​The Innovation (Why this matters):\n​3D Density: Traditional farming is limited by surface area (trays). WVC utilizes the entire volume of the tank, increasing yield per square foot exponentially.\n​Zero Recurring Costs: No soil, rockwool, or mats required. Once you have the tank, the cost of consumables drops to zero.\n​Zero Pests: Spider mites and thrips cannot survive underwater. This creates mechanical sterility without pesticides.\n​The Resilience &amp; Safety:\n​Thermal Battery: Water holds temperature 4x better than air, protecting roots from extreme heat in drought zones.\n​Sanitation: The tank acts as a ""Biological Firewall,"" isolating food from contaminated soil or runoff.\n​Closed Loop: Water is filtered and reused for near-zero evaporative loss.\n​The Protocol:\n​Setup: Works with standard aquarium bubblers or nanobubblers.\n​Biology: Plants exhibit ""squiggly"" stems, proving they are growing in a modified gravity environment. Roots remain white and clean, allowing for 100% biomass consumption (roots + shoots).\n​Survival: A collapsible bucket, seeds, and a solar bubbler can provide life-saving nutrition in 7 days.\n​Open Source License:\nMy name is Andrew Weightman. I am releasing this method under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. It is free to use, adapt, and scale globally.

Temperature controlled base that is extremely efficient (repurposed freezer with temp controller added, PVC pipe structure internally, custom lid made from 1.5 inch insulation, holes cut in the top for dwc)\n2. Aluminum structure for vertical light mounting, heat dissipation, rigidity\n3. Over-engineered led lighting system providing 1.5x the predicted amount of light, dimmable, active air cooling, and aluminum mounts routed into the base for additional cooling\n4. Three 5 gallon DWC containers in the middle of the setup for large plants\n5. 1/8th inch hardwood wrap and styling reminiscent of an outdoor planting bed with a trellis\n6. (Phase 2) Four tower systems, two continuous flow, two medium reservoir hybrid systems vertically stacked towards the back of the system (hybrid system design is a completely different post).\n7. (Phase 2) Humidifier and inline fans originating from the temperature controlled base for air and humidity, controlled by esp32 sensors.\n8. (Phase 2) Automated pH control.

My wife complained of a musty smell coming from the tent. I couldn’t smell it but my son could as well. Pulled out the pods and noticed a sludge on the roots again. This is the second and maybe third time I’ve felt with this over the last 2 weeks. Most recent change involved new hoses and a full bleach bath for all the components. Sat all the pods in a peroxide bath for a bit too. I used hydro guard and garden friendly fungicide in the reservoir. PH’d the RO with citric acid and baking soda after adding cal mag. The last thing I added was Biothrive Grow and it’s been running for 3 days. I have 2 air stones in the reservoir. The rail is plugged to eliminate light leak. Res is open on top but it’s on the bottom shelf. I’m going to clean it all again tonight but I wonder what’s causing the repeated issue. Room temp is 73 with ample air circulation. Any help would be appreciated. My wife is threatening to banish me to the basement. I just got upgraded to an extra room that’s off our bedroom.

It has been said that they grow well together with the same...EC\n\nSo... it came with a pump, but not a tub/reservoir for the water, and I have no idea what to get for the EC (other than whatever is the lowest EC because they thrive in that)\nSo, any advice on getting started? I only have the system. I haven't gotten seeds yet. Nor whatever I need to measure the EC to keep that in the 0.8-1.6 range, nor the food... I would kinda need to start nearly from scratch, lol. Any one have any ideas on what's best for doing this? Or should I just start out doing this all in the soil? Seems more manageable tbh, but the plus is I can grow indoors year round if I learn to do the the hydroponics thing...\n\nI do have a few grow lights too I was using before I built my greenhouse. Wondering if it's in a greenhouse if it'll need the grow lights or if the sun is good. But that's for the future... unless that's an easier thing, but I'd probably have to make sure the pump cord and remote is safe for outdoors and can be good in my waterproof box i have for my heater plugs. I have heaters in there to keep my tropical plants alive in the winter, and they lasted through last winter. And that's guava, June plum, soursop etc that need 40° to survive the winter. \n\nSo... any ideas for this noob? Is it even worth doing? And after you get the ph and ec right, how often do you usually monitor the ec and ph and how often do you add food? Like when the levels are wonky?

I'm really short on time these days so I'm wondering if someone could point me in the right direction on deciding which unit to get (Canada).

Perhaps some tiny flowers so that she can pick/give them to people if this is possible.\n\n\nAlso noting that I realize you guys are all the real deal and based on what I've read you're highly skilled in hydroponics.

NPK and Mn are the fastest to be absorbed by plants, NH42+ faster than NO3- but in any case they are the ones that are removed from the solution first. The slowest ones are Ca and B. Everyone else is in the middle of the two. The problem arises when continuing to feed with the same solution, usually unbalanced (i.e. rich in calcium ... think of formulas for all uses, since 99% of the time is the main source of nitric nitrogen, without considering since it is an immobile nutrient, which can precipitate with phosphorus and then they add a lot in the formulas we also have over 200+ ppm, in practice Ca greater than nitrogen when generally nitrogen should be practically the same amount of all the other elements put together) the EC that we see remain in solution over time before changing A tank is mainly calcium, boron and also sulphur, also in excess in formulations since the difficult plant absorbs more than necessary without causing toxicity, it is a joker paper that is used to balance nutrients a little without it being too important if it is 20ppm or 200ppm... but guess what? It is important, because the accumulation will also make it toxic and make the pH completely unstable. It matters in systems in recirculation systems, that’s why some people can maintain the same nutrients for months, in the test we talk about 3 months (or maybe 10 weeks I could be wrong) and they still consider it at the low level. I pay cents for nutrients, but working less (cleaning every 3 weeks requires a morning or an afternoon for all tanks, I wouldn’t want to do it every 7 days ever again!).\n\nSo why can some people push the EC so much? Because calcium is absorbed so slowly that you can put an avalanche compared to any other nutrient excluding sulphur, the others to follow... who has more nitrogen as is right will see toxicity much sooner, I hope you will join us with your experience and obviously with scientific papers to confirm and deny what I am communicating in this friendly discussion!

That said, the big news for today's update is the quantity of berries harvested. In all my prior years, by week 10 I had maybe 4-5kg of strawberries harvested with the ramp up beginning in the next week or two for the first push. Being that this year seems to be accelerated due to the September heat, the first push is just starting to wind down with today's harvest. In total including today's strawberries, I have harvested 21.2 kg. But, here's the better part! Looking back at all prior data, 20kg wasn't reached until closer to week 14-16 in every prior year, so I am very happy with the results this year so far. I'll also note that in prior years, all flowers were paint brush pollinated (ending in February / March of last year). This year has exclusively been wind pollination, so that quantity metric also has that going for it.\n\nBeyond this, fairly standard cause and effects. Temperature in the grow has settled down to where I want it to be because we're around freezing temperature outside. This has driven Brix values up from 10-12 to the current 14-15 (Albion strawberries) since the last post. This will climb more as we get towards January and February when I can really cool the nights down further.\n\nThe previous post's fertigation routine hasn't changed, nor have the [mmol/L targets](https://www.haifa-group.com/crop-guide/vegetables/strawberry-fertilizer/crop-guide-strawberry-fertilizer-recommendations). I'm still following a 4-5 week tank cycle with a top up in the middle of that duration, and a little extra KNO3 to boot.\n\nNew leaf growth continues to look just fine, there is a little salt burn on the old leaves (pictures 6-8 highlight this the best). These leaves have been around for 6-8 weeks, and I'm used to this happening over prior years. I could likely reduce my overall fertilizer concentration (EC) amount, but honestly with the quantity and quality of berries coming in (and quality that much more than ever before), I'll stay the course for now. The results right now are definitely good enough for my family to eat.\n\nOedema has settled down with the lower temperatures too. Some of the oldest leaves have more discoloration (chlorosis) on them due to what was an emerging spider mite infestation. The good news is the predator bugs seem to have taken care of any visible spider mites as no new webs have been seen on any of the foliage for the past \~2-3 weeks. Tissue analysis across the grow comes back basically where nutrient values need to be relative to the values [Haifa](https://www.haifa-group.com/crop-guide/vegetables/strawberry-fertilizer/crop-guide-strawberry-1) has for guidance. It's for sure not a N shortage based on the analysis results! The leading candidate is Mn, but Mn can be tricky (excluding where spider mites have been as those leaves all show chlorosis where webs were present). I know in soil, Mn applications can take 12-18 months for (fruit) trees to show. Hydroponics obviously is different, but Mn can take a bit of time here as well (not 12-18 months though)! I could foliar if I really felt frisky!\n\nPowdery mildew was also emerging at the last post time. I've completed the 4 week spray cycle I always do at this point in the grow (K-bicarb followed by H2SO4 alternating every 7 days), and there's no visible mildew anymore on any surface.\n\nThe Harmony strawberries have produced some berries. They remind me of Royal Royce, but are softer and more tart. I'm still firmly in the Albion camp as my favourite strawberry from the \~7 varieties I've grown. The Harmony plants themselves are also quite a bit bigger than Albions, and I think a room full of harmony strawberries in these grow bags would overcrowd each other resulting in some plant loss. Again, they seem to be on par with Royal Royce plants. Excellent cross pollinators for Albions though.\n\nI expect the next few weeks to have a lower harvest quantity due to ramping down from the first berry cycle, however we should begin to ramp right back up just in time for Christmas. Perhaps I'll make a strawberry rhubarb pie this holiday season!\n\nUntil next update!",,,reddit,2025-11-17T07:42:35.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oz4753,,0.5255,Hydroponics,62,32,1oz4753,Strawberry hydroponics Y6 W10 (November 2025 edition).

I’ve got a small beginner setup in mind, but I’m hoping for some input from people who’ve been doing this for a while.\n\nMy long-term idea is to eventually scale up and grow lettuce to sell locally as a small side hustle. I’m in northern Canada where it’s below freezing for about half the year, and I have a big loft in my barn that I could insulate and turn into a grow space.\n\nI’ve thought about using a greenhouse, but I’m honestly not sure if that’s realistic here. My guess is that heating a greenhouse all winter would be crazy expensive, especially if I want consistent year-round production. If anyone in a cold climate has managed to do it affordably, I’d love to hear about it.\n\nIf I go indoors, I know I’d be relying 100% on artificial lighting. The one thing I have going for me is that our hydro rates are cheaper from 7 pm to 7 am, so I was thinking about running the lights mainly overnight to help with costs.\n\nI’d appreciate any feedback — especially from people who’ve scaled up from hobby systems or anyone growing in colder climates.

While I’ve had great success with DWC, I’m switching to simplify maintenance and reduce the number of individual systems I have to manage. I have a few questions about setup, flooding, and medium choices.\n\nCurrent Setup\n\n* 4x Clones started in 4"" rockwool cubes.\n* Transplanted into 4x 2-gallon fabric pots filled with hydroton.\n* Bottom of the cube is at sitting at a height of 3"" and I am flooding to a height of 2"".\n\nQuestion: Will this setup work, or should I flood higher to a waterline of 3-4""? \n\nGoing forward I would like to eventually move away from rockwool as my media outside of the 1-1.5"" starter plug because of how much water rockwool retains. However, if rockwool works well for you, please tell me about it! \n\nQuestions:\n\n* What is the best ebb and flow media? Hydroton, Coco Coir, or rockwool.\n* What is the best pot for ebb and flow? Fabric, plastic, or netpot? \n* What should my flood/waterline height be? (I understand this is media/containerize dependent but please enlighten me) \n* How long should my flood cycle be? Currently, at a 2"" flood height, my fill and drain cycle takes about 12 minutes. If I add another spacer to the drain fitting, the waterline rises to 3‑3/4"" and the cycle extends to roughly 20 minutes.\n\n  \nPlease tell me all of your ebb and flow tips and tricks!

I just set up my Botanicare 3x3 flood table and have been filling it a few times to make sure everything is working properly. Right now, it’s taking roughly double the time to drain than it does to fill. \n\nFrom my understanding, flood cycles should ideally stay under 15 minutes which includes both fill &amp; drain times together. I'm cutting it pretty close, if even at all, on some of these water levels because of the drain time. \n\nAlso, a little side note, because of this I am not able to make full use of my overflow drain because I am forced to have my pump shutoff right as the desired water level is achieved in order to leave enough time for the table to drain. This means I am not cycling the water during my fills. Is that a problem too? (I understand probably not but I don't like it lol)\n\n  \nTo show you a timeframe of things, in order for my table to fill and drain at a 3-3/4"" waterline it takes 6 minutes to fill and 12-13minutes to drain (almost 20min total). \n\n\*Important to note I am using a [660gph water pump ](https://www.amazon.com/VIVOSUN-Submersible-Fountain-Aquarium-Hydroponics/dp/B086QHTGZ5/ref=sr_1_8?crid=3620GR3XHP4NX&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.SPVznuZoJWstSz6haDizeUvUnf0os_x2qF7ia5bsiQB5DOnk0CtnYqKDbCDWKZu9FSas3F1VNBt8S2DNdnXgAxQRr2vDxdNAwyHRntIC-eBr1Me-mrQSqCcYjvqxOmApq8d8HxltHEBHbv32uQW9Sja4u9WqdeoWirW8onrqB0-YzdPiM6gjNj8Nn4n1c2Qgl6fCwgrtnZ4glf5j9-R9g-WFEDtSg1WHOzhsjaduHrkN7tNDjLNJKyiCpiDjvTJKeTABwHpZZWf6H91LZ--l_bxaUw21OKrIp5z05JCUfeY.UrcdKlMGZjCuRIYp7YuFqwmp_Oi5mPIYUCuoOMJHMck&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=water%2Bpump%2Bhydroponic&amp;qid=1762749450&amp;sprefix=water%2Bpump%2Bhydr%2Caps%2C117&amp;sr=8-8&amp;th=1) pumping and draining through a 1/2"" tube.

I did try swapping the lines making the 3/4"" tube my main and the 1/2"" tube my overflow but the water was going in faster than it would drain in the overflow with that setup which leave me prone to flooding so I swapped back.\n\n  \nAm I ok?

The images should help to understand what happened. Everything seemed to be going well to start. I sprouted and placed 3 pepper plants into some net pots and placed those into the tops of some old Olive containers and filled the bottom with nutrient solution. They seemed to thrive and develop healthy roots as far as I can tell in image 2.\n\nBut then,  the leaves seemed to be a darker green than they should be and the plants were leaning heavily, trying to get into sunlight (see image 3). Then, (as seen in images 4 and 5) the leaves start growing all wrinkly and deformed.  This was also when they got hit by pests, which I sprayed with Neem Oil. I was also told that changing the nutrient solution should be done after a couple months. So I decided to change out the pots with ones with fresh solution and placed the plants into direct sunlight.\n\nThe images 6 and 7 are the result of 1 day in the sunlight in their new pots. The 2 green pots are struggling but are putting out new leaves. The black pot seems to have killed its occupant. And I can only assume the pot being black in direct sun has heated the whole thing and strangled that plant. so What do I do?

I've finally had some time to pick my hydroponics tower project back up, but I want to get some feedback before proceeding. \n\nFor some context, this tower is intended to be in an outdoor greenhouse in zone 9b in Arizona. \n\n**For the tower:**\n\nAt this stage I have 3D printed the majority of the tower and cups. I used PETG for durability, heat tolerance, and UV resistance and chose a black filament to reduce light transmission and slow algea growth. I may add an additional segment, but I intend to keep the tower short for now. \n\nIn order to prevent algea from growing in the textured layers and reduce heat absorption, I need to coat the interior of the tower in a smooth, food safe coating and the exterior in a paint that it's light reflective and non-toxic. For the former, I picked up a 2 part epoxy resin produced by Craft Resin. Though the product advertises itself as ""food safe"", the informational packet inside makes the much less reassuring claim, ""once fully cured, safe for incidental food contact"". Is this degree so food safety acceptable for this application, or should I seek another product? If so, are there any that you recommend?\n\n**For the base:**\n\nI am currently planning to use a food safe storage container that I got for cheap at auction. The biggest current challenge here is how to attach the tower. This will likely be solve by 3D modeling and printing an adapter, then treating it as above. \n\nThe other issue as that the container has relatively thin walls which do allow some light transmission. I should probably coat the exterior with a paint which makes the vessel fully opaque and does not absorb too much light. Is there anything that you would recommend for this purpose?\n\n**For the electronics:**\n\nAt least for now, I am planning on a dumb system with just a pump and a switch.

However, if you try this and it does root, carefully remove the popsicle stick once the roots grow a few inches long; otherwise, it might interfere with how your plant grows later. Leave the twine in the root ball.\n\nImage descriptions:\n\n* Picture 1: A macro shot demonstrating the core of this observation.\n* Picture 2: An image of the environment where the observed response developed. The container has seven cuttings in total.\n* Picture 3: The three cuttings that exhibited the observed response.\n* Picture 4: The five cuttings that did not exhibit the same response, despite being in almost identical conditions for the same amount of time.\n\nWhat I did before the core observation:\n\n* Took cuttings with sterile tools from a flowering lantana plant, but avoided taking flowering stems. Taken in early November 2025 from a white lantana in Tucson, Arizona.\n* Filled a cut-off green soda bottle with bti-treated filtered water and some freshly chopped aloe vera gel, taken from a fresh leaf without additives.\n* Removed the lower leaves of the cuttings.\n* Put the longest cuttings in the container directly (the bottom of the stem was touching the container bottom).\n* For ones that were too short, I used a single loose overhand knot to affix them to a popsicle stick, to make them taller, so they wouldn't fall in and get submerged.\n* Put them under a full-spectrum grow light at high (full sun) intensity, on 12 hours, off 12 hours, with the temperature average at 72°F and humidity average at 30%.\n* After a week soaking in the aloe vera water, I changed it out for regular bti-treated water.\n* Waited one more week without any notable changes.\n\nCore observation:\n\n* Suddenly, and over the course of no more than 24 hours, adventitious roots quickly formed ONLY where the twine touched the stems.\n\n*\[See the edit below for a revised hypothesis.\]* I hypothesize that the twine soaked up the auxins and other growth hormones from the aloe vera solution, and then, after the water change, it kept the natural rooting compounds in contact with the plant. I also think it is possible that the twine gently abraded the outer layer to expose bits of the cambium, which I have heard helps some plants root.\n\nI plan on designing and running a controlled experiment with several trials to see if I can make sense of this, but I'm really new to biology in general, so I wanted to share this here first to see if anyone else has heard of this or otherwise has input.\n\nI'm pretty sure I can, at the very least, use this to develop a technique to root lantanas WAY faster in water, by binding twine at many points. We'll see!\n\nEDIT: Based on a comment below, I have revised my hypothesis! **I think that the pressure of the twine pushing the stem against the stick caused a thigmomorphogenic response, which persistently increased auxin levels in the area, which then persistently increased WOX-LBD levels in the area, which encouraged the growth of adventitious root primordia, which led to accelerated adventitious root formation when compared to plants without such a mechanical force being applied.** [Here is a 2020 study that seems to support this hypothesis.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7364541/#:~:text=Auxin%20mediates%20the%20touch%2Dinduced%20mechanical%20stimulation%20of,windy%20conditions%20in%20Brachypodium%20distachyon%20%2D%20PMC.) If this is true, then just wrapping a semi-hardwood cutting in any random string against any broad, rigid backing should give better rooting, regardless of the rooting media used. However, it would also mean that failure to remove the mechanical force after root formation would overstress the stem and result in a shorter, stalkier plant. **Therefore, if you wish to experiment with this method, I suggest gently sliding the backing support out of the bindings once adventitious roots reach 1""-2"" long, while leaving the roots and binding material as undisturbed as possible.** Because of this requirement to slide the backing support out smoothly, I do highly suggest a popsicle stick or a smooth, flat strip of plastic to minimize damage to the roots when you remove it. Additionally, because the binding material must stay inside the root ball, I suggest using a natural, biodegradable material like jute twine.\n\nEDIT 2: [I have made a post on r/propagation that describes this observation and my experimental technique. If you want to run experiments on this and share your results, I suggest doing it there!](https://www.reddit.com/r/propagation/comments/1p88ato/i_think_i_have_discovered_a_way_to_get_lantana/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button)\n\n# Definitions\n\n* BTI / bti\n   * The bacteria known as *Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis*, the active ingredient in Mosquito Dunks. It produces a compound that acts as a highly targeted pesticide, selectively killing mosquito, fungus gnat, and fruit fly larvae. It is not known to harm anything other than the aforementioned organisms, and only during their larval stage.\n* Thigmomorphogenesis\n   * The tendency of a plant to initiate or modify new growth based on mechanical forces, such as wind or animals brushing against the plant.\n* Auxin / IAA / Indole-3-Acetic Acid\n   * The primary active growth hormone in plants. It mediates nearly every process in plant development in one way or another.\n* IBA / Indole-3-Butyric Acid\n   * A relatively inactive, more stable form of IAA. This is naturally produced in plants, and it is the active ingredient in nearly all commercial rooting hormone solutions. Plants can convert this into IAA for use in mediating their growth and adaptive responses.\n* Differentiated Cells\n   * Cells that have a defined purpose. For example, the cells in the petals of a flower are different than the cells in the roots.\n* Tissue\n   * A collection of differentiated cells that perform a similar function and/or have a similar structure.\n* Organ\n   * A specialized structure made of a collection of different tissues that work together to accomplish a specific function.\n* Stem\n   * The organ of a plant that provides a central support and vascular system for the plant. This is usually above ground in seed-grown plants.\n* Root\n   * The organ of a plant that uptakes nutrients and water from the surrounding environment, and/or provides mechanical support for the plant. These are usually below ground.\n* Adventitious Roots (AR)\n   * Roots that form from the stem of a plant, or form in an otherwise unusual location. These are the roots that are formed during vegetative propagation, and they are different from the roots formed when a plant is grown from seed.\n* WOX-LBD\n   * A family of proteins that drives the formation of newly differentiated cells at tissue boundaries.

To make a long story short - anyone who works in the field or ever had a botanical analysis done on a plant at a lab, how thorough of an examination can typically be done? Most companies I've been able to find online are clearly oriented to agricultural plants and common herbs so I am uncertain if they can conduct a complete chemical analysis on a wild plant or if this is something more commonly done in a research lab. Which I assume is a little less accessible to the public. My goal is to have a complete picture of what chemical compounds are found in something like Frostweed (Verbesina virginica). Something not very well studied as far as I know.   \n\n\nTo make a short story long, in case it helps. I downloaded INaturalist about 2 years ago - went down the rabbit hole. I am now super into Botany, foraging, horticulture, and collecting plants. Today, I stepped out of my car at worked, looked over, saw some Frostweed (Verbesina virginica), I've gone ahead and collected some seeds and will be preserving, and growing some of this stuff for my own experiments come spring. Here's why I asked the question - This plant also goes by the name Indian Tobacco as it was used as a tobacco substitute by native peoples. But on further researcher - it appears there's little understanding of the plant and the actual chemical compounds that make it up. This is something I've noticed quite a few times in my exploration of plants and I'm starting to wonder if there's some citizen science stuff I can do to help. So now I'm looking at how I can have an in-depth botanical analysis conducted on my samples I grow next year but am confused as to how far I can have a wild plant analyzed at a lab. What is recorded about the plant states it has poisonous compounds - but no information about how much nor what it means by poisonous. Poisonous like tobacco? Spinach? or belladonna? All contain toxic/poisonous compounds but are on ENTIRELY different worlds of dangerous. I. want. to. know.\n\nGetting a Mass Spectrometer and learning how to  prepare samples and test them is of interest to me but out of the question due to price limitations and room currently available in my workshop. \n\nAnyone have any advice or even alternative ideas on how I might be able to make myself useful? Learning for learning sake is something that doesn't work for me. I have to learn towards a useful purpose. If I'm going to be learning about all these wild plants what can I do to contribute - even in a small way - to a greater understanding of these plants? \n\nSorry for the wall of text. I can sometimes over explain for some people I think.

One of the leads (1A in Key A) says ""Spikes entirely staminate (i.e., no perigynia present)"". This doesn't make sense to me, as I thought all sedges have perigynia on spikes.\n\nSo maybe it means ""*Some* spikes are entirely staminate""...yet the species under 1A that I've looked at, such as C. exilis, usually have bisexual spikes: ""spike solitary, with staminate flowers below the perigynia, rarely unisexual, with up to 27 perigynia"" (from the description of C. exilis); or C. gynocrates: ""spikes solitary...usually entirely carpellate, sometimes entirely staminate, or with staminate flowers above the perigynia"". So it sounds like neither of these typically has entirely staminate spikes.\n\nThe other lead in the couplet contrasting with this one (1B) is ""Spikes with at least some perigynia"".

The leaves are oblong to obovate with shallow, symmetrical sinuses. Some leaves have deeper sinuses towards the bottom more chatacteristic of Q. macrocarpa. The bark is coarse and ridged, and slightly flaky. A few of the young oaks exhibit more typical Q. macrocarpa bark traits, with more blocky ridges and deeper furrows. There is a single, large Q. macrocarpa (Bur Oak) present in this terrace. \n\nI'll explain better the habitat they're present in too: this terrace forest is located on the northern bank of the Sheyenne which is a 30 foot tall cutbank where the river is deeply incised. The elevation gradually drops by a few feet as you walk due north. The northern edge is defined by a series of oxbow lakes and associated wetlands (there's a map photo above). Generally wet to mesic conditions, trending more wet as you approach the oxbows, and more mesic as you approach the cutbank (30 foot tall bluff overlooking the river). \n\nThe soil is moderately well drained, loamy alluvium. This terrace is above the active floodplain of the current river, and hosts a block of mesic Ash-Basswood forest from near the cutbank out to where the pin on the map is located. To the north, the canopy composition is the same, but soil conditions trend towards wet-mesic, to hydric at the margins. The subcanopy is a continuous carpet of Hydrophyllum virginianum (Waterleaf), except for the area near the bluff edge. Viburnum lentago is scattered throughout, but absent from the bluff edge region, where Chokecherry (Prunus virginiana) is becoming common. The single, large Bur Oak is located on the ""boundary"" where soils begin trending more wet.\n\nOk, with that out of the way, back to the oaks! The traits exhibited by these trees are consistent - and the habitat, a wet-mesic terrace forest above an active floodplain, is the perfect niche for Swamp White Oak. These potential intermediates are regenerating very well. I am honestly leaning towards the possibility that the large individual Bur Oak may be introgressed. Bur Oak is completely absent from this entire terrace, only becoming abundant on upslope sites above the floodplain and terraces. Closest stand of Bur Oak is a half mile west in upslope Oak-Aspen woodland. \n\nThe only oak regeneration of ANY kind is from these oaks in this terrace. Other areas of the river do not exhibit any signs of oak regen. in related forest types. I have no way to confirm if they are hybrid (Quercus x schuettei) or not, but it REALLY seems like it!

Ginkgo trees are the only living member of their genus, family, order, class, division! Ginkgo trees have actually existed and hardly changed for roughly 270 million years! They have coexisted with the dinosaurs! Unfortunately ginkgo trees when they are planted are often done so as cultivars. A cultivar is a clone of a tree in this case usually a male ginkgo tree. This is done because male trees don’t make stinky seeds. However this is actually a bad thing since because cultivars are clones they lack genetic diversity. Genetic diversity is important. With low genetic diversity like cultivars If one tree is susceptible to a new disease all the other clones are equally susceptible. While no serious diseases infects ginkgo trees now diseases mutate often and quickly so it’s only a matter of time. And actually with the gros michel banana cultivar this happened where a disease could infect one so it infected all of the rest equally. To get ginkgo trees with higher genetic diversity it’s best to grow them from seed. This is because with seeds there is genetic recombination and genetic mixing between parent trees and an increased chance for mutations. Some of these mutations may be beneficial and give the seedling resistance to a new disease or even something like more drought or flood resistance or heat resistance this is especially important because of climate change. Female ginkgo trees while stinky are a good thing because they make seeds. It’s important to note that male ginkgo trees are still important to since female ginkgo trees need their pollen to make seeds. It’s best to have 50% male and 50% female trees. Which actually from seed there is a 50% chance of male or female. Also female ginkgo trees actually absorb male ginkgo pollen this may help reduce spring allergies. Also to reduce the smell of a female ginkgo tree it’s best to plant a potential female ginkgo tree with an area surrounded by dirt and plants and not concrete or asphalt. This is because dirt and plants keep the ground much cooler this reduces evaporation of the smelly chemicals of the seeds when they drop. Also while ginkgo trees are not native to the USA and most of the world they do not become invasive since they grow very slow. Also fun fact ginkgo trees used to grow in North America a few million years ago and there is even a petrified ginkgo forest in Washington State. Also to grow ginkgo trees from seed the seeds need 3 months of cold moist stratification the easiest way to do this is place the seeds in a ziplock in moist sand or soil and put it in the refrigerator. Ginkgo trees are in general amazing and beautiful trees simply worth growing! And they of course do look very beautiful in the fall!

Mexicana subsp. caerulea, or S. nigra subsp. cerulea?! Tree or shrub?! AHHHH!!! Our Native Blue Elderberry (at least we can agree on a common name!) is a plant with many, sometimes opposing, multitudes. However, while the former typically plague only the taxonomically inclined; the increasing presence of mature green-fruited forms have caused quite a commotion among pretty much everyone with a stake in this magnificent plant.\n\nWe’ve been called out by botanists and herbalists alike; who claim that despite what our senses tell us (common being among them), these simply “don’t exist”. So, we figured it’s about “ripe” time to break it down for the naysayers! We’ve been studying these forms for the last couple years and this past summer, met up with @Pascal_Baudar at the peak of their ripeness to take a closer look and see what we might be able to uncover.  \n\nAs previously implied, West Coast Elderberry show up as a variety of habits. While generally a shrub peaking at around 8m (much shorter here in the Sierra Nevada); specimens in southern California (most notably Malibu Creek) can reach heights greatly exceeding that number, with a single trunk whose circumference is larger than my own personal wingspan. Stem has a large, spongy, cotton-like pith which is easily removed. Leaves are odd-pinnately compound with oppositely arranged serrately margined leaflets. Inflorescence is a panicle of cymes (often confused as an umbel), which is generally flat-topped and tightly packed with greenish-white flowers. Their drupe, berry-like fruits follow, typically maturing to a deep blue or purple with glaucus yeast coating. Which takes us right back-round to the controversy.\n\nIn the Los Angeles area, ranging from the coast to the Cajon Pass, there are a number of specimens whose mature drupes are green! These hold all the characteristics of a ripeness: glaucus coating, tender fruits and freely falling from their pedicels. While they used to trick even the birds, they’ve recently become wise to the color variation; devouring fruits with the voraciousness they deserve. Interestingly enough, these green fruits are sweeter than most of the blue forms, pointing to a significant difference in phytochemistry as well as morphology.\n\nSo what’s going on? While our research is just barely leaving it’s infancy; early thoughts range from climate to hybridization to herbivory response. Upcoming DNA sequencing and teasing out the individual chemical makeup should hopefully provide a bit more insight! \n\nPhoto 1-3 Green Form\nPhoto 4 Rose Form\nPhoto 5-6 Typical Form\nPhoto 7-8 Flowers\nPhoto 9 Difficult to see, but we can see the green form on the left and typical form bottom right. *Note - there are a few unripe clusters center/right, not to be confused with the green drupes.

I am not a professional in any way when it comes to this sort of thing. I'm just a hobbyist who loves plants and is fascinated by ecology, taxonomy, and generally how the natural world works, and I have absolutely no idea how to find out about minor syntax in old botany books. I am hoping that there are some people here who are more familiar with the actual literature of Carl Linneus, but if this isn't the place, then anyone who can point me towards a subreddit that is more likely to be able to answer my question, your help would be greatly appreciated. \n\nSo, I have relatively recently found out that my area has native orchids and carnivorous plants, and I have been wanting to look into them more. I decided to start with one specific species of carnivorous plant that didn't seem too uncommon, Drosera rotundifolia.\n\nI recently found out about [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/), a source of free eBooks that are in the public domain. And since I know that D. rotundifolia is credited as originally being described by Carl Linneus, I went and found their eBook version of his book, Species Plantarum, which (as far as I could tell) had his first official description of the plant in question.\n\n""It'll be fun!"" I thought. ""I can print out the pages and practice my amateur bookbinding! Translating the Latin word for word, then trying to deciphering the grammar can be like a game! It probably won't have nearly all of the info I'm looking for, but it should at least be a fun starting point! Plus, I can have it on hand for other plants I might want to look into!"" Only to be disappointed by what probably should have been an unsurprising lack of reference images, and an incredibly short D. rotundifolia entry. \n\n&gt;**DROSERA.**\n\n&gt;*rotundifolia.*\n\n&gt;1. Drosera scapis radicatis, foliis orbiculatis. *Fl. lapp. 109. Fl. suec. 257. Mat. med. 158. Fl. zeyl. 120. Gron. virg. 35.

Ros solis. *Thal. herc. t. 9. f. 1.*\n\n&gt;*Habitat in* Europæ, Asiæ, Americæ *paludibus*.\n\nSince this obviously isn't much, I decided to at least squeeze as much info as I could out of it before moving on, and what I've managed to translate so far is, ""The scape is rooted, the leaves are disk shaped, list of reference books, the sun dew leaf is round, more reference books, Salsirora s. Sun dew, Thal. herc. t. 9. f. 1. Grows in swamps in Europe, Asia, and America.""\n\nI've managed to identify most of the referenced books (almost none of them seem to reference the plant on the given page, possibly due to different name usage, but that's a problem for another day), but there is still ONE line that is kind of driving me nuts. ""Salsirora s. Ros solis. *Thal. herc. t. 9. f. 1.*""\n\n* ""Salsirora"" SEEMS to be translating to ""Saltier""? I don’t know why? Does D. rotundifolia taste salty or something???\n* I have NO idea what ""s."" is supposed to mean.\n* I've already figured out ""Ros solis."" in the previous line as being ""Sun dew.""\n* ""*Thal. herc.*"" is formatted like it's another book reference or something, but I can't find any clarification for it in either the  author's OR the website's numerous notes explaining abbreviations and stuff.\n* And I don't entirely understand ""*t. 9. f. 1.*"" either. It looks like another page reference, but there's two of them, and they have letters. Do they stand for ""Text"" and ""Folio"" or something? If so, how are the numbers so small? Most of the listed sources are putting D. rotundifolia WAY further back in their books.\n\nIt seems like such a minor syntax thing that no obvious sources feel the need to explain it, or they just missed it, or I'm just getting hung up over something irrelevant.\n\nIf anyone can explain it to me so I can finally just move on, I would be SO grateful!",,,reddit,2025-09-29T05:33:33.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/botany/comments/1nt3o58/what_did_linneus_mean_by_salsirora_s_and_thal/,,-0.6248,botany,11,6,1nt3o58,"What did Linneus Mean by ""Salsirora s."" and ""Thal. herc. t. 9. f. 1.""???",,,,,,,,

Our team at Genesis on Demand has created a ground-breaking light-based device that stimulates plant development using precision wavebands and increases photosynthesis—without chemicals or genetic modification.\n\nWe are now accepting applications for a select few cream of the crop indoor farming businesses and science-focused researchers into our Genesis Pioneer Program. Participants will receive a FREE Wavelength Emitting Electronic Device™ and direct access to our R&amp;D pipeline. All we ask in return is feedback, grow logs, and curiosity.\n\nThis is an opportunity to shape the future of food, science, and cellular adaptation.Reply if you're ready. Let’s grow something revolutionary.\n\nGenesis on Demand\n\nEmail: [GenesisonDemand@proton.me](mailto:GenesisonDemand@proton.me)\n\nPhone: 207-616-8758\n\n**Humanity's Turning Point: A Call to the Brave**\n\nThis is not another marketing campaign. This is not another startup launch. This is a call to action for those who understand that we are at the edge of a precipice—and we must choose which way to leap. The global food system is broken, the atmosphere is polluted, and the biological health of mankind is spiraling.\n\nBut what if we could rewire life at the cellular level without touching a single gene? What if we could amplify the natural brilliance of plants, increase their healing capacity, and remove the stranglehold of big ag, big pharma, and big tech—all through the power of light?\n\nOur patented Wavelength Emitting Electronic Device™ (W.E.E.D.) is not just a grow light. It's a biological tool of liberation. It emits a highly targeted spectrum of monochromatic light (465nm, 485nm, 670nm), at very high amplitudes, tuned precisely to stimulate photoreceptors inside plant cells—unlocking faster growth, deeper nutrient density, and even new biological traits. This device triggers advanced photosynthesis, speeds up development, and creates plant matter unlike anything grown under the sun or conventional LEDs.\n\nWe are offering a rare opportunity to become part of this unfolding revolution. To test it. To study it. To experiment with it. To co-create the next generation of agricultural biotech.\n\n**Calling All Indoor Farmers**\n\nA Rare Invitation to Be the First to Grow the Future\n\nWe’re calling on a select few exceptional indoor cultivation businesses to become early adopters in our Genesis Pioneer Program — a groundbreaking initiative that offers you direct access to the most advanced photosynthetic lighting technology ever developed: the Wavelength Emitting Electronic Device™ (W.E.E.D.).\n\nThis is not just a new grow light. This is a patented optoelectronic system engineered to unlock deeper genetic expression, speed up plant growth cycles, and drastically enhance nutrient density of all plant life, at all stages of growth — all without chemicals, GMOs, or gimmicks. For those of you already growing amazing things, this is your chance to push the boundaries of what your plants can truly become. As a plug and play it will make anything your growing do better.\n\nWe are looking for one standout business from each of the following sectors:\n\n\n\n Hemp Growers: Interested in exploring how targeted light stimulation can elevate fiber, flower, or CBD yields without synthetic alteration.\n\n Microgreen Producers: Focused on medicinal nutrition and extreme efficiency? Let us help you grow even more potent superfoods in even less time.\n\n Mushroom Growers: We are fascinated by how photo-biology interacts with fungal development, and we want you to explore that with us.\n\n Vegetable &amp; Herb Growers: Imagine greens that stay fresher longer, basil that packs more flavor, and lettuces that store more antioxidants — all grown with enhanced photosynthesis.\n\n Medicinal/Healing Plant Farmers: If you grow plants with a purpose — ayurvedic herbs, rare ethnobotanicals, traditional medicine strains — we want to help you amplify their healing power.\n\nWhat We Provide:\n\n A free Wavelength Emitting Electronic Device™  \n Early access to additional units before commercial release  \n Technical support and direct collaboration with our R&amp;D team  \n Features in our media campaigns, publications, and scientific outreach  \n Priority consideration for exclusive long-term partnerships\n\nWhat We Ask in Return:\n\n Maintain a bi-weekly grow log with detailed photos, notes, and honest observations  \n Participate in structured and exploratory experiments  \n Commit to a minimum testing period of 6-12 months  \n Be open to a two-way relationship — your input shapes the future of this technology\n\nThis is not a sales pitch.

6935dcdd31d8c40e50b4b42b,1jvu4oi,TRUE,General Agriculture,Negative,-0.6504,,,,,,,Abhilashkaliyath,"Hi everyone,\n\nI’m a 28-year-old plant science student from India, and I’m reaching out to this community with a heavy heart and a sincere request for advice. Nearly two years ago, I had to discontinue my PhD from a reputed research institute in Delhi after a deeply painful and disillusioning experience. I’ve been trying to find a way forward ever since, but it feels like I’ve reached a dead end.\n\nDuring my time in the lab, I discovered that certain results—originally produced by a previous student and approved by my supervisor—had been fabricated and later published. I was the one who uncovered the issue and raised questions, but no one stood by me. Although I have the evidence to support my claims, I didn’t escalate it to higher authorities at the time, as I was worried about how it might affect my future in research. Ironically, that decision backfired.\n\nWhen I later tried to explain my discontinuation during interviews, I struggled. At first, I used excuses like health or personal reasons, but eventually I started telling the truth. Some interviewers listened with empathy, but I sensed that it left a negative impression—that I might be “too difficult” or a risk to the lab’s dynamic.\n\nTo make matters worse, I later learned that my former PI held a grudge against me and spoke negatively about me to others. Given how interconnected the research world is—especially within plant science—it became clear that this would shadow my future prospects. I had my own CSIR-JRF fellowship, but due to procedural issues at the time of discontinuation, I couldn’t re-register. Despite applying to 30–40 positions abroad and many within India, I haven’t been able to secure a path forward.\n\nThroughout my academic life, I was known for being passionate, hardworking, and committed. I believed that being honest, critical, and ethical would be strengths in science. But over time, I’ve come to realize that these values can isolate you, especially if you raise uncomfortable questions. I never sought favor from supervisors or avoided difficult conversations. I wasn’t the kind of student who stayed quiet when something unethical happened—not just to me, but to others too.\n\nOutside academics, I was always available to my peers—mentoring, offering support, even helping with research doubts or emotional challenges. But after I left research, many of those connections disappeared. People I once helped no longer checked in, and that sense of abandonment hit me hard.\n\nMy family—who come from a humble background and initially opposed my entry into research—placed enormous hopes on me. I was the first to even pursue postgraduate education. Watching me lose my way has left them devastated, and I carry the weight of their disappointment every day.\n\nI still love science. I was good at it. And even though I feel broken right now, I don’t want to let go of my passion for plant biology and microbiology. If anyone here has experienced anything similar, or if you have suggestions—courses to consider, labs or groups that might value someone like me, or just words of encouragement—I’d truly appreciate hearing from you.\n\nThank you for reading this long post. I didn’t expect to be in this position, but I’m hoping that speaking to fellow plant scientists across the world might help me see a new way forward.\n",,,reddit,2025-04-10T15:24:45.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/plantScience/comments/1jvu4oi/struggles_after_leaving_my_phdlooking_for/,,-0.6504,plantScience,4,0,1jvu4oi,Struggles After Leaving My PhD—Looking for Guidance from the Plant Science Community,,,,,,,,

I know that dried herbs typically lose their flavor after a few years; does this same thing happen with the substances that cause plants to be toxic to, say, a pet that ate a dried leaf from an old plant?\n\nWhat about if the plant is kept inside vs outside, do the plant's toxins stay intact or do they degrade into other chemicals?\n\nMost importantly, if the toxic plant also had toxic pollen, (as in lilies), does the toxin degrade differently in different parts of the plant, and in the case of pollen, would the toxin degrade at all?\n\nThe plant I am most curious about this in is lilies, I am trying to figure out how long it has to be until the pollen is considered unharmful.

Ill link article below but here are the cliff notes.  Dark grown seedlings treated with a mixture of ethylene gas for 3 days primed the seedlings to improve seedlings.  Article states   “Plants treated this way had longer primary roots, more and longer lateral roots, and larger aerial tissue and were more tolerant to high temperature, salt, and recovery from hypoxia stress. “  so ive been working a way to test this out with the upcoming spring and think i got it.  Certain fruits; bananas, apples, and pears give off ethylene gas when ripening (which is why you dont store these fruits next to others because the gas expedites ripening)  so here is a picture of my proposed setup to test this out.\n\n64 oz mason jar, Small 0.5w aquarium air pump, hooked to syringe filter, then tubing ran thru mason jar lid to bottom of jar with airstone.  Fruit down in the jar, then tubing coming from lid to seedling container with syringe filter before entering seedling container, then seedling container air hole covered in a filter patch or micropore tape.\n\nSyringe filters keep air going in/coming out of jar clean and pest free, micropore tape over air outlet of seedling container to keep pests out, this gives a constant flow of ethylene gas as the fruit releases it, do all this under your sink in the dark once seeds show signs of germination and start growing into seedling phase. \n\nWith the air pump tubing being in the bottom of the jar and an airstone attached, im hoping to push the ethylene gas thru the tubing into the seedling container to keep an ethylene/air mixture in the container for the duration of the application.  After 3 days stopping the gas exchange and moving tray into light.  I know its far from perfect but i figured it may be fun to play with in regards to starting my vegetable plants for spring garden.\n\nI figured it would be fun to test side by side and see how it goes.  If the plants are in-fact bigger, stronger, more tolerant, it may be worth trying to set up a larger scale in the future.\n\nHere is the link for the journal article\n\nhttps://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/article/2/7/pgad216/7221976",,,reddit,2023-12-31T04:51:01.000Z,https://i.redd.it/qlwlz8dtmi9c1.jpeg,,0.4551,plantScience,3,0,18usvsy,Ethylene-mediated metabolic priming,,,,,,,,

I was originally pursuing this major because I had plans to go to fashion school and specialize in more sustainable textiles like non-plastic vegan leathers, but I realized if I'm doing all this work to someday build a self-sufficient and plant-laden property for myself, I could just put my energy into the practice of building useful and ecologically sound landscapes for others. The world needs less aspiring streetwear brands, and more people to grow plants. I have no plans to move any time soon.\n\nGiven my somewhat specialized interests, I was wondering if anyone had any advice as to a prudent next step. I am leaning towards the Cal Poly Pomona BS in Landscape Architecture, and have looked into the UCLA Extension program for landscape architecture, and have been recommended to look into USC. The Los Angeles Permaculture Academy also seems interesting, and I have normally gotten jobs in the past via internship or just getting a lower position and working my way up, but it seems as if a degree is extremely helpful for getting in on the design side of things. My goal is to own and operate (and hopefully expand) a landscaping company that builds immaculate garden boxes and other structures, and helps walk people through maintaining their plants (although we can always provide maintenance service). Generally, entrepreneurs aren't the best with getting through school, but at this point in my life i think a little piece of paper would help my opportunities a lot.\n\nSorry for rambling, thanks for reading if you do, please advise if you have advice.

So, is there a good resource somewhere I can get the basics of plant science? Any good books or websites? I would also like to learn about how water is used by cacti since we are doing a duplicate study in the Chihuahuan desert.

The pathway isn't the issue, but I'm trying to find out how many kb of DNA I can put into the caset and still get good results from the transformation? \n\n\nHi there! I'm writing a proposal for funding for an experiment where the end goal is a cultivar of red lettuce (Lactuca Sativa) which is able to produce ergosterol, or pro vitamin D. There are tons of mushrooms that make this compound, however this is a 21+ step enzymatic reaction. In stead of trying to ID the genes in the fungi of choice and then optimizing the codons from there I was thinking of taking the sequence of the enzymes, turning those back into DNA while choosing a more optimized codon bias, and then adding exons as needed. Once that is done I was going to have a caset made with CMV promotor to be grown in agrobacterium and then use them to transform the lettuce. Only problem is I know 21+ enzymes worth of DNA is going to be massive, and I don't know how I'll fit all of that into a caset. I was already thinking of doing multiple transformations but how many would depend on how big the caset can be and that really depends on how much DNA can successfully be integrated into the lettuce and THATS where I need your help!

I recently released a book on Brassinosteroids, the 6th plant hormone group. I had the opportunity to be part of the research team who discovered Brassinolide over 50 years ago and have now compiled all the research done into a monogram. Brassinosteroids not only increase efficiency of plant growth but also contribute to increasing crop yield. I hope some of you may find this interesting.

I've read some research material and it looks like and environment with an high concentration of CO2 leads to an increased consumption of CO2 by the plants through photosynthesis. For some plants this behavior is more accentuated than in others, but this is not the point now (I will spend more words on it soon).  \nI was thinking: we could set up some ""CO2 disposal centers"", consisting of plantations of plants that not only have a big CO2 consumption rate, but also have an high increase of the consumption rate when the CO2 is highly concentrated. Those plants would be ""closed"" in a sort of transparent dome, so that we have a closed environment in which the CO2 can be inserted and kept under high concentration, without leaving in the atmosphere.  \nUnder this hyphotesis, at this point the factories would stock the CO2 produced and would bring it to these ""CO2 disposal centers"" to be eliminated, instead of just releasing it in the atmosphere. Since the ""CO2 disposal centers"" are closed environments and the CO2 is trapped in the transparent dome and consumed by the plants, this would lead to a great help in the fight against climate change. In case of very big factories, a ""CO2 disposal center"" could be set up right next to them, in order to avoid producing CO2 through the trips from the factory to the center.  \nThe big game-changing factor here is the fact that the CO2 released in the air is consumed by the plants all over the world, but not in an efficent way as it is not highly concentrated, plus not all the plants consume it with a satisfying rate. The ""CO2 disposal centers"" would instead work under efficient CO2 concentrarion conditions and with the best possible existing plants for the job.  \nI don't know if this is a nice idea or if it is ridicolous: as I said, I'm not an expert in the field and I would really like to have your opinion. Please, consider that I'm focusing only on the scientific-technological aspect here, not the political effort that would be necessary to force the factories to treat the CO2 in this way.  \nFor completeness, I report here the material that I've read:  [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287481359\_The\_Effect\_of\_CO2\_Concentration\_on\_the\_CO2\_Exchange\_Rate\_in\_a\_Small\_Plant\_Stand\_of\_Cucumber\_during\_Different\_Periods\_of\_the\_Day](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/287481359_The_Effect_of_CO2_Concentration_on_the_CO2_Exchange_Rate_in_a_Small_Plant_Stand_of_Cucumber_during_Different_Periods_of_the_Day) ,  [https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/effects-of-rising-atmospheric-concentrations-of-carbon-13254108/](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/effects-of-rising-atmospheric-concentrations-of-carbon-13254108/)",,,reddit,2021-01-28T23:46:23.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/plantScience/comments/l74b1a/idea_for_mitigating_the_co2_pollution_trhough/,,-0.5048,plantScience,2,2,l74b1a,Idea for mitigating the CO2 pollution trhough efficent photosynthesis,,,,,,,,

We're a horizontal urban farming alliance in the Deep South. Members put in an annual due of labor-hours in exchange for clear ownership, both of the products and our governance. We're deeply [distributist](http://en.wikipedia.com/wiki/Distributism) in philosophy but it's structurally agreeable to a wide variety of ideologies. We're fortunate to live an area that simultaneously has a strong background in middle-scale agriculture but also [food deserts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_desert) cause demand for our work. \n\nIt's indeed *work*, a lot of time, effort, and skill is involved. Modern technology is both asset and burden, especially with IP laws. Tools and other material resources are largely communal. We have equipment libraries, seed libraries, and so on and so forth. Even utilities and supplies aren't owned by any one person. If someone(s) loses/breaks something, they're held responsible but the commune covers costs related to general maintenance. It can get complicated when purely monetary expenses come into play. People point fingers and there's all sorts of drama. \n\nI've only been involved in urban farming for less than a decade but I'm grateful to be involved at all.",,,reddit,2025-07-08T03:47:50.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanfarming/comments/1lu7tfq/on_the_7th_of_july_2009_our_coop_was_founded/,,0.7995,urbanfarming,11,2,1lu7tfq,On the 7th of July 2009 our co-op was founded.

6935dcef31d8c40e50b4b5a3,1lu7kty,TRUE,General Agriculture,Neutral,0,,,,,,,its_oliviaaaaa,"Hi everyone. \n\nI've been staking these boards for a while but I think now it's time for me to make a post/ask question(s) because there's some specific info I'm trying to suss out. \n\nSo, first the basics. I've been thinking about starting an urban farm off and on again for the last several years. I have some experience farming, though not a ton of it. Before my family came to the States for example we were farmers on a communal farm and my family always made sure we grew at least some of the staples of our own food for as long as I can remember: tomatoes, peppers, carrots, cucumbers, melons, sometimes corn depending on space, squash and legumes, and as I got older, chickens for eggs. That said I have never done it in a professional context for profit. \n\nI currently work in a different field (I'm a mechanic for the government). It's a good job and pays well with good benefits, but I don't love it or the people I work with or the ridiculous policies. Or the fact I have to commute for so long every day, and would love to at some point reduce my commute to ""walk outside"". In the next 18 months or so I plan to relocate (with this current job), probably to the inland Bay Area of California (Santa Rosa, San Jose, Sacramento, etc) where land is at least somewhat reasonable, and want to start doing research and planning now to see if in a couple of years this could be something viable for a long term business that keeps my books in the black. \n\nI'm familiar with drip agriculture and hydroponics. I'm familiar with the climate and what generally grows well in those zones. I know that the most financially viable products are the ones that are quick growing, high yield and potentially high profit per unit (micro greens, mushrooms, herbs, etc) and secondly after that high quality finished ""artisanal"" farm products (sauces, chutneys, sausages, cheese, etc) and intend to focus on these aspects primarily at first, though I do hope to be able to scale up/add more aspects to the business: eggs, cannabis (since it's legal where I live now and where I will move to), honey, maybe compost? Natural beauty products like sponges made from natural lufa, artisanal dog products (kibble, wet food, chews, etc), etc etc etc. I have so many ideas. \n\nMy questions are more on the practical side of things: how do I get started? How to find affordable land? How do I go about getting funding -- either from a bank or from an angel investor? How do I build a name and reputation and find customers?

I’m working on a long-term project to build a self-sustaining, off-grid community — something that can survive outside collapsing systems and offer a better way to live.\n\nRight now we’re still in the early stages: gathering people, designing modular structures, and laying the foundation for a full eco-society. It’ll take years to complete, but the planning we do now is critical.\n\nWe’re aiming to use recycled and reclaimed materials — stuff that would otherwise pollute the ocean — to help protect marine life and create something truly sustainable from the ground up.\n\nThat’s why I’m reaching out to experienced farmers, homesteaders, permaculture folks, or anyone with hands-on growing knowledge. I’d really appreciate help or advice on things like:\n	•	How much dirt/gravel is needed for stable, healthy planting areas\n	•	Best starter crops for a new community\n	•	Tips for natural soil enrichment, pest control, and water efficiency\n	•	Plants that grow well in limited or unconventional spaces\n	•	Anything else you wish someone told you before you started farming\n\nEven small insights are hugely valuable at this stage. If you’ve grown food in tough spots — off-grid, floating setups, or just smart small-space gardening — I’d love to hear from you.\n\nThanks in advance for your time. Every bit of knowledge helps us get closer to building something better.\n",,,reddit,2025-06-24T10:32:41.000Z,https://www.reddit.com/r/urbanfarming/comments/1lj2hid/looking_for_farmers_growers_need_advice_for/,,0.6228,urbanfarming,2,4,1lj2hid,"Looking for Farmers &amp; Growers — Need Advice for Future Off-Grid, Eco-Friendly Community",,,,,,,,

6935dcfc31d8c40e50b4b671,118281b,TRUE,General Agriculture,Positive,0.7641,,,,,,,ccranger01,"Vertical gardening is an innovative method of urban farming that allows for the cultivation of crops in a vertical space. It is a popular solution for growing food in small urban areas, where space is limited. In recent years, there have been several innovative methods of vertical gardening that have been developed.\n\nOne such method is the use of living walls, which involve vertical planters that are mounted to a wall or other vertical surface. These planters are designed to maximize growing space, with plants arranged in a tiered structure. The living wall is often integrated with an irrigation system that helps to deliver water and nutrients to the plants.\n\nAnother innovative method of vertical gardening is the use of hydroponics. This involves growing plants in a nutrient-rich water solution, rather than in soil. Hydroponic systems can be designed to be vertical, allowing for the cultivation of crops in a compact space. They are also very efficient, using significantly less water than traditional farming methods.\n\nAeroponics is another method of vertical gardening that involves growing plants in an air or mist environment. The plants are suspended in the air and receive nutrients and water through a fine mist. This method is highly efficient and can produce larger yields than other methods of vertical gardening.\n\nThe High Output Pocket Farm is another example of an innovative method of vertical gardening. The system uses a series of stacked trays that are designed to maximize growing space. The trays are integrated with a built-in irrigation system and LED grow light, allowing for the easy cultivation of a wide range of crops in a small space.\n\nIn conclusion, there are several innovative methods of vertical gardening that have been developed in recent years. These methods provide sustainable and efficient solutions for growing food in small urban areas. The High Output Pocket Farm is just one example of how urban agriculture can be made more accessible and sustainable, allowing people to grow their own food and reduce their carbon footprint. With the development of new technologies and techniques, we can continue to improve our ability to grow food in a sustainable and efficient way.\n\n[***Take control of your food production with the High Output Pocket Farm - the perfect solution for small-space urban agriculture.

I'm working on a personal project to create an app that will pair you up with neighbors to swap fresh, homegrown produce.

I was doing some of this myself and had so much surplus produce that I started giving some away to neighbors. In return, apples and lemons started showing up at my doorstep. It was such a nice feeling that I wanted to share it. Help people save some money, learn some new names, and help limit food waste, if even slightly.

Peaches (unlike apples) grow quality fruit from planting seeds (peach pits). **You don't need to GRAFT!!**! The fruit of every tree is similar to the fruit of the mother tree (unlike apples). Peach trees are also very hardy. They are almost like weeds. **The goal of this project is to make Michigan into THEY peach capital (sorry Georgia).**\n\nThere will be a map depicted on r/MichiganPeaches reddit page of Michigan's counties. If you plant the most peach trees/pits in a county, your initials will be inscribed in that county along with the number of peach pits that you planted. You don't need to confirm that the peaches are growing as they probably wont grow for many months. Not all of them will grow but a lot of them will. In 3-5 years, they should start producing peaches. Squirrels and other animals like birds, will further spread the peach pits of these trees to grow more trees. Eventually, we will cover Michigan with peaches and finally overtake the evil peach lord GEORGIA!!!!!\n\n**Want to play?**\n\nHere is how:\n\n1. plant peach pits (3 inches into the ground).\n2. keep an accurate record of the number of peach pits you planted\n3. post on r/MichiganPeaches page how many peach pits you have planted and in what county (and your initials or name that you want written in the county map)\n4. If someone plants more peach pits in that county, your name will be removed. You can continue to update your peach pit count to retake the county.\n5. Enjoy the peaches in 3-5 years when they start producing.\n\nBest of luck players!!!
